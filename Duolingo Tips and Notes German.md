# Duolingo · Tips and Notes @ duome.eu
#### Basics 1 #4 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Basics-1/practice) ^

### Welcome to German :)

Welcome to the German course! We will provide you with tips and notes throughout the course. However, be aware that these are optional. Only read them when you feel stuck, or when you are interested in the details. You can use the course without them.

Often, it's best to just **dive into the practice**. See how it goes! You can always revisit the Notes section later on.

### Capitalizing nouns

In German, **all nouns are capitalized**. For example, "my name" is _mein **N**ame_, and "the apple" is _der **A**pfel_. This helps you identify which words are the nouns in a sentence.

### German genders are strange

Nouns in German are either **feminine, masculine or neuter**. For example, _Frau_ (woman) is feminine, _Mann_ (man) is masculine, and _Kind_ (child) is neuter.

While some nouns (Frau, Mann, …) have **natural gender** like in English (a woman is female, a man is male), **most nouns have grammatical gender** (depends on word ending, or seemingly random).

For example, _Mädchen_ (girl) is neuter, because all words ending in _\-chen_ are neuter. _Wasser_ (water) is neuter, but _Cola_ is feminine, and _Saft_ (juice) is masculine.

It is important to **learn every noun along with its gender** because parts of German sentences change depending on the gender of their nouns.

For now, just remember that the **indefinite article** (a/an) _ein_ is used for masculine and neuter nouns, and _eine_ is used for feminine nouns. Stay with us to find out how "cases" will later modify these.


|gender   |indefinite article|
|---------|------------------|
|masculine|ein Mann          |
|neuter   |ein Mädchen       |
|feminine |eine Frau         |


### Verb conjugations

#### Conjugating regular verbs

**Verb conjugation** in German is more complex than in English. To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the stem of the verb and **add the ending** corresponding to any of the grammatical persons, which you can simply memorize. For now, here are the singular forms:

Example: _trinken_ (to drink)


|English person         |ending|German example  |
|-----------------------|------|----------------|
|I                      |-e    |ich trinke      |
|you (singular informal)|-st   |du trinkst      |
|he/she/it              |-t    |er/sie/es trinkt|


#### Conjugations of the verb _sein_ (to be)

Like in English, _sein_ (to be) is completely irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized. Again, you will learn the plural forms soon.


|English                    |German       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|I am                       |ich bin      |
|you (singular informal) are|du bist      |
|he/she/it is               |er/sie/es ist|


### Umlauts

**Umlauts** are letters (more specifically vowels) that have two dots above them and appear in some German words like _Mädchen_.

_Literally, "Umlaut" means "around the sound," because its function is to change how the vowel sounds._


|no umlaut|umlaut|
|---------|------|
|a        |ä     |
|o        |ö     |
|u        |ü     |


An umlaut change may change the meaning. That's why it's important not to ignore those little dots.

If you can't type these, a workaround is to type "oe" instead of "ö", for example.

### No continuous aspect

In German, there's **no continuous aspect**. There are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: _Ich trinke._

There's no such thing as _Ich bin trinke_ or _Ich bin trinken!_

_When translating into English, how can I tell whether to use the simple (I drink) or the continuous form (I am drinking)?_

Unless the context suggests otherwise, either form should be accepted.

### Welcome to the Wonderful World of German :)

#### How to use this course

These tips will guide you through the course. The course is designed so you can discover German without resorting to grammar notes. However, if you feel lost, you can check these notes, they will clarify things.

**Always play first**! In language learning, practice counts more than theory.

If you have questions about a specific sentence, refer to **sentence discussions**. You can either already find answers there, or state your own question.

The bubbles in the main view are called **skills**, the whole course is called a **tree**. Each skill is divided into several **lessons**.

The most important thing in learning is that you **relax and enjoy yourself**. With this course, you can explore German in a playful way. **Don't worry too much about remembering things**. Your brain will do that for you, as long as you're having fun and keep your eyes and ears open.

#### What you learn in this skill

In this skill, you learn the following things:

*   German can be very **similar to English**.
    
*   **Plural forms** are kind of **irregular**. Think "foot/feet" or "child/children". There are patterns; you will discover them while you master this course. For example, **nouns ending in _\-e_ always have a plural ending in _\-en_**.
    
*   As in English, **"to be" is highly irregular**.
    
*   Soon you will discover that **gender works differently** than in English. In this skill, we only show you "feminine" nouns. Keep that in mind when later on, you encounter words from the two other genders.
    
*   _But wait, why is "Katze" feminine? My cat is a guy!_ — Yes, did we mention that gender works differently than in English? :) _Katze_ is _die_ (feminine) because the word ends in an _\-e_. Check out the next skill for more on this!
    

#### The #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/The/practice) ^

### Definite articles

As mentioned in _Basics 1_, German nouns have one of **three genders**: **feminine, masculine or neuter**.

While they sometimes correspond to a _natural gender_ ("der Mann" is male), most often the gender will depend on the word, not on the object it describes. For example, the word "das Mädchen" (the girl) ends in "-chen", hence it is neuter. This is called _grammatical gender_.

Each gender has its own definite article. **_Der_** is used for masculine nouns, **_das_** for neuter, and **_die_** for feminine. Later in this course you will learn that these might be modified according to "case".


|gender   |definite (the)|indefinite (a/an)|
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
|masculine|der Mann      |ein Mann         |
|neuter   |das Mädchen   |ein Mädchen      |
|feminine |die Frau      |eine Frau        |


### Conjugating verbs

Here are the conjugation tables from "Basics 1" (where you can find a more detailed explanation) again.

_trinken_ (to drink)


|English person         |ending|German example  |
|-----------------------|------|----------------|
|I                      |-e    |ich trinke      |
|you (singular informal)|-st   |du trinkst      |
|he/she/it              |-t    |er/sie/es trinkt|


_sein_ (to be)


|English                    |German       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|I am                       |ich bin      |
|you (singular informal) are|du bist      |
|he/she/it is               |er/sie/es ist|


### Generic vs. specific (German is not Spanish or French)

Just like in English, using or dropping the definite article makes the _difference between specific and generic_.

I like _bread_ = Ich mag _Brot_ (bread in general)

I like _the bread_ = Ich mag _das Brot_ (specific bread)

A good general rule is to use an article when you would use one in English. If there is none in English, don't use one in German.

There are some slight differences when using a few abstract nouns, but we'll see about that later.

#### Family #6 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Family/practice) ^

### Modal verbs: Plural forms

In the previous lesson, you learned the singular forms of some modal verbs:


|      |      |     |
|------|------|-----|
|ich   |kann  |mag  |
|du    |kannst|magst|
|er/sie|kann  |kann |


In the plural, these verbs have regular endings. They often use a different vowel than the singular forms:


|   |      |     |
|---|------|-----|
|wir|können|mögen|
|sie|können|mögen|


### Infinitives, some plural forms

In German, every verb has an infinitive form (similar to "to learn" in English). The first and third person plural are always the same:


|          |learn |drive |have |
|----------|------|------|-----|
|infinitive|lernen|fahren|haben|
|wir       |lernen|fahren|haben|
|sie       |lernen|fahren|haben|


Here is a revision of the singular forms:


|         |learn |drive |have|
|---------|------|------|----|
|ich      |lerne |fahre |habe|
|du       |lernst|fährst|hast|
|er/sie/es|lernt |fährt |hat |


### More pronouns

#### Already known

So far, you learned how to say "my, your, his, her":


|Engl.     |fem./pl.|masc. Nom./neut.|masc. Akk.|
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
|my        |meine   |mein            |meinen    |
|your (sg.)|deine   |dein            |deinen    |
|his/its   |seine   |sein            |seinen    |
|her/their |ihre    |ihr             |ihren     |


Remember that the endings are the same as for "ein" and "kein":


|Engl.|fem./pl.|masc. Nom./neut.|masc. Akk.|
|-----|--------|----------------|----------|
|a(n) |eine    |ein             |einen     |
|no   |keine   |kein            |keinen    |


"Their" is the same as "her" in German, and "its" the same as "his".

If you find these hard to remember, just keep practicing! Why not revisit some of the earlier skills, too?

#### More plural pronouns

In addition, you learn "our" and "your (plural)" here:


|Engl.     |fem./pl.|masc. Nom./neut.|masc. Akk.|
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
|our       |unsere  |unser           |unseren   |
|your (pl.)|eure    |euer            |euren     |
|their     |ihre    |ihr             |ihren     |


Notice that "euer" loses an "e" when it gets a suffix.

Again, instead of trying to memorize tables, it is best to just jump into practice, and use them until you get a feeling for them.

### Numbers: 1-12

By now, you encountered the numbers from one to twelve:


|   |     |   |   |      |
|---|-----|---|---|------|
|1  |eins |   |7  |sieben|
|2  |zwei |   |8  |acht  |
|3  |drei |   |9  |neun  |
|4  |vier |   |10 |zehn  |
|5  |fünf |   |11 |elf   |
|6  |sechs|   |12 |zwölf |


Notice that they are very similar to the numbers in English.

These numbers never change form, apart from number one. _Eins_ is only used when nothing comes after it:

*   Um _eins_ schwimme ich. (I swim at one.)
*   Um _ein_ Uhr schwimme ich. (I swim at one o'clock).
*   Ich habe _eine_ Tochter. (I have one daughter.)

#### Home #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Home/practice) ^

### Noun gender

As mentioned in the last skill, gender works differently than in English. English has _natural gender_:

*   woman — feminine (she)
*   man — masculine (he)
*   house — neuter (it)

Some words in German are like this:

*   Frau (woman) — feminine (she)
*   Mann (man) — masculine (he)

However, **most nouns use _grammatical gender_**.

Often, it is the noun ending that determines the "gender":

*   Gitarr**e** — feminine (she)
*   Comput**er** — masculine (he)
*   Mäd**chen** (girl) — neuter (it)

Things (as opposed to living being or ideas) ending in _\-e_ are almost always feminine (she):

*   Rose, Gitarre, Toilette, Lampe, …

Nouns ending in _\-er_ are often masculine (he):

*   Computer, Videorekorder, …

Nouns ending in _\-chen_ are always neuter (it).

There are more patterns like this. You will encounter them later in the course.

However, for many common nouns, the endings got lost over time; so for these, you will need to memorize the gender.

*   Tisch, Stuhl — masculine (he)
*   Haus, Bett, Sofa, Licht — neuter (it)

### Articles and related words

In English, you have "a(n)" (the indefinite article) and "the" (the definite article), and that's it.

In German, these can be quite variable, depending on context.

#### Feminine and plural forms

Feminine (_she_) nouns use _eine_ for "a(n)":

*   Das ist _eine_ Lampe! (That is _a_ lamp!)

Possessive pronouns ("my, your, …") use the same endings:

*   Das ist _meine_ Lampe! (That is _my_ lamp!)
*   Das ist _deine_ Lampe. (That is _your_ lamp.)

There is also the special _kein_, which roughly works like "not a" in English:

*   Das ist _keine_ Lampe! (That is _not a_ lamp!)

For "the", feminine nouns use "die" in German:

*   Wer ist _die_ Frau? (Who is _the_ woman?)
*   _Die_ Rose ist hier. (_The_ rose is here.)

Plural endings often look like feminine forms:

*   _Die_ Rosen sind hier. (_The_ roses are here.)
*   Das sind _meine_ Rosen! (Those are _my_ roses!)
*   Das sind _keine_ Sofas! (Those are _not_ sofas!)

Of course, as for English "a(n)", there is no plural for _eine_; it means "one"!

#### Non-feminine forms

The other two genders share the same indefinite article ("a(n)"): they use _ein_.

Again, possessive pronouns ("my, your, …") and some other words will use the same form.

*   Das ist _ein_ Computer. (That is _a_ computer.)
*   Das ist _mein_ Computer! (That is _my_ computer!)
*   Hier ist _dein_ Bett. (Here is _your_ bed.)
*   Das ist _kein_ Sofa! (That is _not a_ sofa!)

All genders are the same in plural:

*   Hier sind _die_ Rosen. (Here are _the_ roses.)
*   Hier sind _die_ Sofas. (Here are _the_ sofas.)

#### Article overview

Here is a quick overview of the forms you you will practice in this and the next skills:


|English|fem. |plural|not fem.|
|-------|-----|------|--------|
|a(n)   |eine |—     |ein     |
|my     |meine|meine |mein    |
|your   |deine|deine |dein    |
|no     |keine|keine |kein    |


### Plurals

As mentioned in the last skill, German plurals are rather irregular. Here are some forms you will encounter in this skill:


|singular    |plural  |
|------------|--------|
|eine Lampe  |Lampen  |
|eine Tochter|Töchter |
|ein Bett    |Betten  |
|ein Sofa    |Sofas   |
|ein Stuhl   |Stühle  |
|ein Computer|Computer|


As you can see, sometimes it's simple:

*   All nouns with an _\-e_ ending will end in _\-en_ in the plural.

Sometimes the vowel will slightly change (think "foot/feet").

A few nouns (mostly ending in _\-er_) don't change at all in the plural. For these, you need to look at the context (for example the verb form) to know which one is which.

*   Das _ist_ _mein_ Computer. (This is my computer.)
*   Das _**sind** mein**e**_ Computer. (These are my computers.)

Don't worry about memorizing these now. Just relax, explore, and let German work on you for a while :)

### Pronunciation

German pronunciation is pretty straightforward: unlike in English, a letter will normally always be pronounced in the same way.

However, some letters have different sounds than in English. We will remind you of these throughout the course; just try your best to copy what you actually hear for now.

Words from other languages (such as French or English) sometimes sound like the original:

*   Computer (sounds like in English)
*   Garage (sounds kind of like in French)

### Special characters

By now, you have encountered some letters that don't exist in English:

*   ä ö ü — These are vowels that **do not sound like a o u**. They are called "umlauts". A workaround for people without English keyboard is to write "ae oe ue" instead.
    
*   ß — this is not a B, but rather a **special kind of S**. One name for it is "es-zett". Swiss people (and people writing on a non-German keyboard) type "ss" instead.
    

#### Basics 2 #7 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Basics-2/practice) ^

### German plurals are also strange :)

In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding _\-(e)s_ at the end of the word. In German, the transformation is more complex. You will learn details about this in a later lesson.

In some languages (such as French or Spanish), genders are also differentiated in the plural. In German, the **plural form does not depend on what gender** the singular form is.

Regardless of grammatical gender, **all plural nouns take the definite article _die_** (You will later learn how "cases" can modify this). This _does not make them feminine_. The grammatical gender of a word never changes. Like many other words, _die_ is simply used for multiple purposes.

Just like in English, there's **no plural indefinite** article.


|English|German  |
|-------|--------|
|a man  |ein Mann|
|men    |Männer  |


### You, you and you

Most languages use different words to address one person, or several people.

In German, when **addressing a single person, use _du_**:

*   _Du_ bist mein Kind. (_You_ are my child.)

If you are talking to **more than one person, use _ihr_**:

*   _Ihr_ seid meine Kinder. (_You_ are my children.)

Some English speakers would use "y'all" or "you guys" for this plural form of "you".

Note that these only work for people you are familiar with (friends, family, …). For others, you would use the formal "you", which we teach later in this course. So stay tuned :)

### _Ihr_ vs. _er_

If you're new to German, _ihr_ and _er_ may sound confusingly similar, but there is actually a difference. _ihr_ sounds similar to the English word "ear", and _er_ sounds similar to the English word "air" (imagine a British/RP accent).

Don't worry if you can't pick up on the difference at first. You may need some more listening practice before you can tell them apart. Also, try using headphones instead of speakers.

**Learn the pronouns together with the verb endings**. This will greatly reduce the amount of ambiguity.

### Verb conjugation

Here is the complete table for conjugating regular verbs:

Example: _trinken_ (to drink)


|English person         |ending|German example  |
|-----------------------|------|----------------|
|I                      |-e    |ich trinke      |
|you (singular informal)|-st   |du trinkst      |
|he/she/it              |-t    |er/sie/es trinkt|
|we                     |-en   |wir trinken     |
|you (plural informal)  |-t    |ihr trinkt      |
|they                   |-en   |sie trinken     |


Notice that the first and the third person plural have the same ending.

And here's the complete table for the irregular verb _sein_ (to be):


|English                    |German       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|I am                       |ich bin      |
|you (singular informal) are|du bist      |
|he/she/it is               |er/sie/es ist|
|we are                     |wir sind     |
|you (plural informal) are  |ihr seid     |
|they are                   |sie sind     |


You will learn about the distinction between "formal" and "informal" later (it's easy).

#### Common Phrases #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Common-Phrases/practice) ^

### Common phrases

Commonly used phrases are often _shortened versions of a longer sentence_. Or they might be _leftovers from some old grammar_ that has otherwise fallen out of use. That means that their grammar might appear strange.

For now, just learn them like you would learn a long word.

#### _Wie geht's?_

There are many ways to ask someone how they are doing. Take "How are you?," "How do you do?" and "How is it going?" as examples. In German, the common phrase or idiom uses the verb _gehen_ (go): _Wie geht es dir?_ (How are you?).

This can be shortened to _Wie geht's?_.

#### _Willkommen_ can be a false friend

In German, _Willkommen_ means welcome as in "Welcome to our home", but it does not mean welcome as in "Thank you - You're welcome". The German for the latter is _Gern geschehen_ (or just _Gern!_) or _Keine Ursache_.

#### _Entschuldigung!_

Sometimes, German words can be a mouthful. Later on, you will find that you can take long words apart, and recognize the meaning from their elements.

Here's an example:


|Part  |Meaning    |
|------|-----------|
|ent-  |de-        |
|Schuld|guilt      |
|-ig   |-y         |
|-gung |noun suffix|


So, _Entschuldigung_ literally means something like "deguiltification": "Take the guilt away from me" :)

### Duo

_Duo_ is the name of Duolingo's mascot (the green owl). He will guide you through this course. If you make him happy, he will make you happy :)

#### You #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/You/practice) ^

#### Sentence structure

While German sentence structure is often similar to English, there are some differences.

One essential feature is the **sentence bracket**. Like in English, one part of the verb changes with the person:

*   Ich _bin_. Du _bist_. (I am. You are.)

This part generally goes into **position 2 of the sentence**.


|1           |2  |…         |
|------------|---|----------|
|Ich         |bin|hier.     |
|Meine Mutter|ist|in Irland.|


The "rest" of the verb **goes to the very end**. In this skill, you will encounter elements that "kind of belong" to the verb. They complement the verb: The verb feels incomplete without them. They are thus called **complement**. These **go to the very end of the sentence**:


|1           |2     |…  |end       |
|------------|------|---|----------|
|Meine Mutter|ist   |…  |in Irland.|
|Ich         |trinke|…  |Tee.      |


By that logic, everything else has to go **between the verb in position 2 and the complement**:


|1           |2     |…  |end       |
|------------|------|---|----------|
|Meine Mutter|ist   |oft|in Irland.|
|Ich         |trinke|oft|Tee.      |


This is one of the most common points of confusion for new learners. **Always pay attention to the sentence structure**. Some combinations that are perfectly fine in English are impossible in German.

#### Yes/No questions

Compare these two English sentences:


|1  |2  |…  |end |
|---|---|---|----|
|You|are|   |old.|
|—  |Are|you|old?|


The first (verb in position 2) is a statement. The second (verb in position 1) is a yes/no question.

German works the same way, for _all_ verbs:


|1  |2      |…  |end    |
|---|-------|---|-------|
|Du |bist   |   |alt.   |
|—  |Bist   |du |alt?   |
|Du |trinkst|   |Kaffee.|
|—  |Trinkst|du |Kaffee?|


Note that here, English is _more complicated_, requiring a "do" construct for most verbs:

*   Do you drink coffee?

#### Verb endings

In English, the verb endings change for the third person singular:

*   I sleep. He sleep_s_.

In German, more persons have their own ending. For _du_ (singular you), this ending will be **the same for all verbs**. **Whenever you see _du_, the verb will end in _\-st_**:

*   Du bi**st**. Du ha**st**. Du komm**st**.

_Du heißt_ looks like an exception, but isn't. The reason is that the strange _ß_ character actually represents an S already: There will never be an _\-s-_ after a _ß_.

#### Verb endings

In the skill _You_, you learned that **_du_ always goes with _\-st_**:

*   Du bi_st_. (You are.)
*   Du sing_st_. (You sing.)

In the same way, **_ich_ (I) normally has an _\-e_ ending to go with**:

*   Ich sing_e_. (I sing.)
*   Ich lern_e_. (I learn.)

This is not completely regular, but works for most verbs. Work on getting the verb endings right, your German will sound a bit weird to native speakers if you don't :)

#### Not

By now, you have encountered _keine/kein_ and _nicht_. These are often confusing for new learners.

Generally, **_kein_ works like _ein_** (has the same ending changes), and can be thought of as _not a_:

*   Das ist _kein_ Haus. (This is _not a_ house.)

In contrast, _nicht_ works like _not_:

*   Das ist _nicht_ mein Haus. (This is _not_ my house.)

There are some situations when it's tricky to say which one is correct, but most often, the following rule helps you out: If you would say **_not a_ or _no_ in English, use _kein_**. **If you only can say _not_, use _nicht_**.

*   Das ist _keine_ Milch. (This is _no_ milk.)
*   Das ist _nicht_ gut. (This is _not_ good.)

Of course, _no_ as in _No, I am not sleeping_ is _nein_ in German.

#### Natural gender

Remember that in German, gender works different than in English. Many nouns have a certain gender because of what the noun looks like (often an ending). It has nothing to do with actual gender.

However, for people, the gender generally (not always) corresponds to the person's gender. There is normally a male and a female version. The female version often has an _\-in_ ending:

*   Freund — male friend
*   Freund_in_ — female friend

### How to type the special characters

As mentioned before, German has four letters that do not exist in English:

*   the umlauts: ä, ö, ü
*   es-zett: ß

Most mobile keyboards provide these when long-pressing a, o, u, and s, respectively.

If you cannot find them, you can always replace these with the following letter combinations:

*   ae, oe, ue for the umlauts
*   ss for the es-zett

#### Origin #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Origin/practice) ^

#### Verb endings

By now, you know all the regular verb endings for singular verbs:


|English       |Ending|Example     |
|--------------|------|------------|
|I             |-e    |ich singe   |
|You (singular)|-st   |du singst   |
|She/He        |-t    |sie/er singt|


As in English, "to be" is highly irregular:


|English       |Form      |
|--------------|----------|
|I             |ich bin   |
|You (singular)|du bist   |
|She/He        |sie/er ist|


Be sure to practice these enough, this will improve your German a lot later on!

#### Articles and related words

As you have noticed, articles are not as simple as in English. Among other things, they correspond to the "gender" of a noun. Remember that this gender does normally not refer to the real "gender" of something, it is just one of three noun classes.


|English    |feminine|plural|masculine|
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
|she/they/he|sie     |sie   |er       |
|the        |die     |die   |der      |
|this       |diese   |diese |dieser   |
|which      |welche  |welche|welcher  |
|mine       |meine   |meine |meiner   |
|yours      |deine   |deine |deiner   |


If you want, compare these with the similar endings for "a(n)" and related words:


|English|feminine|plural|not feminine|
|-------|--------|------|------------|
|a(n)   |eine    |—     |ein         |
|my     |meine   |meine |mein        |
|your   |deine   |deine |dein        |
|not a  |keine   |keine |kein        |


#### _You made a mistake! It should be "die Name"!!_

We mentioned earlier that "words for things" are feminine (die) when they end in _\-e_:

*   die Lampe, die Rose, die Gitarre, die Garage

This does not necessarily extend to nouns that are for abstract concepts, people, or animals. Hence, they may not be feminine.

_Junge_ (boy) and _Chinese_ (Chinese man) are masculine. The reason is simple: They are actually male!

*   **Nouns for people with _\-e_ ending are often masculine**

For abstract ideas (not things, not people), the genders for _\-e_ nouns are all over the place: _Name_ is also masculine, while _Ende_ (end) is neuter. However, _your best bet is still feminine (die)_!

#### Reporting errors

Yes, we do make mistakes! If you find one, please report it. Use the "flag" symbol for this. If you only report in the sentence discussions, we (the course maintainers) might not see it.

Also, please **double-check first**. We get literally thousands of reports every day. More than 99% of them do not report actual errors. Course maintenance is done by volunteers, so here you can do your part :)

#### Where does _auch_ go?

Remember that German has a peculiar, consistent sentence structure:

*   The verb that changes with the person goes in position 2.
*   The rest of the verb goes to the end.
*   Everything else goes in between.

_Auch_ goes between the first and the second part of the verb:


|1  |2    |rest|end       |
|---|-----|----|----------|
|Ich|komme|auch|aus Japan.|


It can _not_ go to the very end, because that would violate German sentence structure.

#### _sondern_ vs. _aber_

Generally, think of _sondern_ as **not A, but B instead**:

*   Das ist kein Mann, _sondern_ eine Frau. (That's not a man; that's a woman.)
*   Ich komme nicht aus Japan, _sondern_ aus China. (I'm not from Japan; I'm from China.)

In other contexts, use _aber_:

*   Ich komme aus China, _aber_ ich lebe in Japan. (I'm from China, but I live in Japan.)
*   Ich komme nicht aus China, _aber_ ich spreche Chinesisch. (I'm not from China, but I speak Chinese.)

#### Accusative Case #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Accusative-Case/practice) ^

### German Cases

In English, the words "he" and "I" can be used as subjects (the ones doing the action in a sentence), and they change to "him" and "me" when they are objects (the ones the action is applied to). Here's an example:


|Subject|Verb|Object|
|-------|----|------|
|I      |see |him   |
|He     |sees|me    |


This is called a **grammatical case**: the same word changes its form, depending on its relationship to the verb. In English, only pronouns have cases. In German, **most words** other than verbs (such as nouns, pronouns, determiners, adjectives, etc.) **have cases**.

You'll learn more about cases later; for now you just need to understand the difference between the two simplest cases: **nominative and accusative**.

The **subject** of a sentence (the one doing the action) is in the **nominative** case. So when we say _Die Frau spielt._ (The woman plays.), "die Frau" is in the nominative.

The _accusative object_ is the thing or person that is directly receiving the action. For example, in _Der Mann sieht den Ball._ (The man sees the ball.), _der Mann_ is the (nominative) subject and _den Ball_ is the (accusative) object.

For the articles, nominative and accusative are nearly the same. Only the masculine ("der") forms change:


|"a(n)"    |masc.|neut.|fem.|
|----------|-----|-----|----|
|Nominative|ein  |ein  |eine|
|Accusative|einen|ein  |eine|



|"the"|m. |n. |f. |pl.|
|-----|---|---|---|---|
|Nom. |der|das|die|die|
|Acc. |den|das|die|die|


### Flexible sentence order

The fact that most words in German are affected by the case explains why the **sentence order is more flexible than in English**. For example, you can say _Das Mädchen hat den Apfel._ (The girl has the apple.) or _Den Apfel hat das Mädchen._. In both cases, _den Apfel_ (the apple) is the accusative object, and _das Mädchen_ is the subject (always nominative).

However, take note that in German, the **verb always has to be in position 2**. If something other than the subject takes up position 1, the **subject will then move after the verb**.

*   Normally, **I drink** water.
*   Normalerweise **trinke ich** Wasser.

### Vowel change in some verbs

A few common verbs change the vowel in the **second and third person singular**.

Here is the table for a verb without vowel change:


|En. person|person   |trinken|
|----------|---------|-------|
|I         |ich      |trinke |
|you (sg.) |du       |trinkst|
|he/she/it |er/sie/es|trinkt |
|we        |wir      |trinken|
|you (pl.) |ihr      |trinkt |
|they      |sie      |trinken|


And here are three verbs with that vowel change. Notice that in the first two verbs, the 2nd and 3rd person singular seem the same. This is just because the _du_ ending _\-st_ merged with the _\-s-_ of the verb stem. This is unrelated to the vowel change.


|person   |lesen|sprechen|
|---------|-----|--------|
|ich      |lese |spreche |
|du       |liest|sprichst|
|er/sie/es|liest|spricht |
|wir      |lesen|sprechen|
|ihr      |lest |sprecht |
|sie      |lesen|sprechen|


Similarly, _essen_ turns to _du isst/er isst_.

_Sprechen_ (to speak) will be introduced in one of the next lessons.

### _Isst_ vs. _ist_

_Isst_ and _ist_ sound exactly the same. So do _Es ist ein Apfel._ and _Es isst ein Apfel._ sound the same?

Yes, but you can tell it's _Es i**s**t ein Apfel_: _Es i**ss**t ein Apfel_ is ungrammatical. The **accusative** of _ein Apfel_ is _ein**en** Apfel_. Hence, _It is eating an apple_ translates as _Es i**ss**t ein**en** Apfel_.

Of course, this only works for _masculine_ nouns. Other forms will look the same in nominative and accusative:

*   Er isst eine Banane.
*   Er ist eine Banane.

Only context will tell you here :)

### _Ich habe Brot_

In English, you can say "I'm having bread" when you really mean that you're eating or about to eat bread. **This does not work in German.** The verb **_haben_ refers to possession only.** Hence, the sentence _Ich habe Brot_ only translates to _I have bread_, not _I'm having bread._ Of course, the same applies to drinks. _Ich habe Wasser_ only translates to _I have water,_ not _I'm having water._

Conjugation is also slightly irregular: two forms lose the _\-b-_.


|English person|German example|
|--------------|--------------|
|I             |ich habe      |
|you (sg.)     |du hast       |
|he/she/it     |er/sie/es hat |
|we            |wir haben     |
|you (pl.)     |ihr habt      |
|they          |sie haben     |


#### Restaurant #3 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Restaurant/practice) ^

### Polite "you"

Remember that German has two ways of expressing "you" (singular and plural)?

Surprise! There is a third form, usually used with people you don't know well. German just uses the third person plural for this (they):


|person |trinken|
|-------|-------|
|du     |trinkst|
|ihr    |trinkt |
|sie/Sie|trinken|


How to know whether the meaning is "they" or "you"? German writes the "you" forms in upper case.

*   Wo sind sie? (Where are they?)
*   Wo sind Sie? (Where are you?)

Of course, at the beginning of the sentence, this does not work. It can then mean both:

*   Sie sind da! (They/You are there!)

When using the polite form, you usually combine it with the last name of a person, and _Herr/Frau_:

*   Guten Tag, Herr Müller! (Good day, Mr Müller!)
*   Willkommen, Frau Schmidt! (Welcome, Mrs Schmidt!)

### Noun endings

As mentioned earlier, sometimes a noun endings gives away the gender:

*   \-chen (das)
*   \-er (often _der_)
*   \-e (often _die_)

A common way to turn a verb into a noun is to add _\-ung_ to the word stem. These nouns will always be feminine:

*   die Wohnung, die Reservierung, die Rechnung

Later on, you will learn more of these regular noun endings.

### _Cup of tea_

In German, you just add the quantity before the noun:

*   eine Tasse Tee (one cup of tea)
*   ein Glas Milch (one glass of milk)

### _Willkommen_

_Willkommen_ only means _welcome_ as a greeting. It will not mean _you're welcome_.

### Past tense

As in English, you can use the present tense to talk about the present and the future:

*   Ich esse! (I am eating!)
*   Ich gehe morgen ins Theater. (I go to the theatre tomorrow.)

Also as in English, the past requires a different tense. Here, you learn how to say "I was":

*   Ich war gestern im Theater. (I was at the theater yesterday.)

The endings are like those of the modal verbs (_müssen, können, …_). But the stem never changes:


|Person   |sein (to be)|können (can)|
|---------|------------|------------|
|ich      |war         |kann        |
|du       |warst       |kannst      |
|er/sie/es|war         |kann        |
|wir      |waren       |können      |
|ihr      |wart        |könnt       |
|sie/Sie  |waren       |können      |


#### I went to Ireland!

Many learners of German struggle with expressing where they went:

*   I _went to_ Ireland.

Germany is actually simpler here: it just uses _ich war_:

*   Ich _war_ in Irland.

#### Need #6 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Need/practice) ^

#### The third gender

Previously, you learned that articles and similar words change according to gender and number. For all words in the following table, _feminine_ and _plural_ forms are the same.


|English      |fem. / pl.|masculine|
|-------------|----------|---------|
|she/they • he|sie       |er       |
|the          |die       |der      |
|this         |diese     |dieser   |
|which        |welche    |welcher  |
|mine         |meine     |meiner   |
|yours        |deine     |deiner   |


There is one more gender (_neuter_). Here are the corresponding forms, together with _masculine_ for comparison:


|English|masc.  |neuter |
|-------|-------|-------|
|he • it|er     |es     |
|the    |der    |das    |
|this   |dieser |dieses |
|which  |welcher|welches|
|mine   |meiner |meines |
|yours  |deiner |deines |


As you see, generally, _feminine_ (and _plural_) ends in _\-e_, _masculine_ in _\-er_, and _neuter_ in _\-es_.

You actually encountered _neuter_ nouns before:

*   das Bett, das Wasser, das Kind, das Sofa, das Telefon, das Zimmer, das Haus

You probably didn't notice, because the indefinite articles (_a(n)_ in English) are the same for _masculine_ and _neuter_:


|English|fem. |pl.  |masc. / neut.|
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|
|a(n)   |eine |—    |ein          |
|no     |keine|keine|kein         |
|my     |meine|meine|mein         |
|your   |deine|deine|dein         |


So, there are two groups of article-like words. The first group has endings like the definite article (_the_), the second like the indefinite article (_a(n)_). The best way to master these is to practice them a lot!

#### Girls are not things!!

Yes, we agree :) Here's what you are used to from English ("natural gender"):

*   the woman — she (_feminine_)
*   the man — he (_masculine_)
*   the lamp — it (_neuter_)

Remember that in German, a lot of "gender" is actually determined by the word form, not by what it means ("grammatical gender"). Hence, _die Lampe_ is _feminine_, because it's a word for a thing, and ends in _\-e_. _Der Computer_ is _masculine_, because most nouns ending in _\-er_ are.

As a general rule, for people, the grammatical gender normally corresponds to the natural gender. For animals and objects, it normally does not.

There are many more of these endings that give away the gender. As mentioned earlier, **_\-chen_ words are always _neuter_**.

*   das Mäd_chen_ (_neuter_)

The ending _\-chen_ signifies a smaller version of something, similar to _\-let_ or so in English (_pig/piglet_). _Magd_ (_maid_) used to mean _woman_ long ago, so _Mädchen_ literally means _little woman_.

#### _Man_

The pronoun _man_ works like English _one/you_:

*   Man kann hier tanzen. (One can dance here.)

As in English, the grammar follows _er_ (_he_):

*   Man brauch_t_ ein Ticket. (One need_s_ a ticket.)

Of course, _man_ does not imply males only. Think "mankind", not "that man".

#### Introduction #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Introduction/practice) ^

### Grammar break!

There is no new grammar in this lesson. If you're confused, you can review the grammar points from earlier lessons.

#### Harness the power of other learners

Or you can check the discussion that's available for each sentence. You can reach these when tapping or clicking on the speech bubble. Your question might already have been answered there. Otherwise, you can leave a comment yourself.

#### Trip #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Trip/practice) ^

### Sentence structure, again.

Remember this important rule of German:

*   The **verb that changes with the person goes in position 2**

This you already know from English.

*   Ich _tanze_. (I _dance_.)
*   Der Mann _kommt_ auch aus China. (The man _is_ also from China.)

In the examples above, you see that the subject ("I", "the man") appears in position 1.

German often puts **things other than subjects in position 1**. But _still_ the verb will appear in position 2! The **subject then has to move behind the verb**.

*   Ich _schwimme_ am Montag oft. (I swim often on Mondays.)
*   Am Montag _schwimme_ ich oft. (On Monday, I often swim.)


|1         |2       |…          |end |
|----------|--------|-----------|----|
|Er        |tanzt   |am Freitag.|    |
|Am Freitag|tanzt   |er.        |    |
|Ich       |schwimme|am Montag  |oft.|
|Am Montag |schwimme|ich        |oft.|


### Some slightly irregular verbs

Most verbs only change the ending. There are a few common verbs that change the main vowel too:


|Person|drive |see   |sleep   |
|------|------|------|--------|
|ich   |fahre |sehe  |schlafe |
|du    |fährst|siehst|schläfst|
|er/sie|fährt |sieht |schläft |


Note that the change happens **only for the second and third person** (singular only).

### _Gehen_ means to walk

In English, you can "go to China by plane".

The German word "gehen" means "to walk" only.

You can't walk by plane, taxi or bus :)

### More pronouns

#### You saw these before

Earlier, you learned that, just as articles, some pronouns change their endings:


|           |a(n)|my   |your |
|-----------|----|-----|-----|
|fem./pl.   |eine|meine|deine|
|masc./neut.|ein |mein |dein |


*   Meine Mutter ist hier.
*   Mein Mann ist hier.


|        |one  |mine  |yours |
|--------|-----|------|------|
|fem./pl.|eine |meine |deine |
|masc.   |einer|meiner|deiner|
|neut.   |eines|meines|deines|


*   Diese Tasche ist _deine_. (This bag is yours.)
*   Die Lampen sind _meine_. (These lamps are mine.)
*   Hier ist einer! (Here is one!)
*   Welcher Computer ist _meiner_? (Which computer is mine?)
*   Das Handy ist _deines_. (That cellphone is yours.)

#### New pronouns

In this skill, you encounter two more:


|           |his/its|her/their|
|-----------|-------|---------|
|masc./neut.|sein   |ihr      |
|fem./pl.   |seine  |ihre     |


As you see, for these forms, "his" and "its" look the same. So do "her" and "their".

*   masculine: sein/ihr Partner. (his/her male partner)
*   neuter: sein/ihr Handy (his/her cellphone)
*   feminine: sein_e_/ihr_e_ Mutter (his/her mother)
*   plural: sein_e_/ihr_e_ Handys (his/her cellphones)


|        |his/its|hers/theirs|
|--------|-------|-----------|
|fem./pl.|seine  |ihre       |
|masc.   |seiner |ihrer      |
|neut.   |seines |ihres      |


*   Der Computer ist _ihrer_. (The computer is hers/theirs.)
*   Das Handy ist _seines/ihres_. (The cellphone is his/"its"/hers/theirs.)

#### Gender overload?

Some learners find this very confusing. "There are two genders within one pronoun!!"

Don't overthink this! As an English speaker, you know the difference between "his" and "her".

English "his" translates to _sein_, plus ending. English "her" translates to _ihr_, plus ending.

The ending is determined just like in the other pronouns:

*   mein_e_ Mutter, mein Vater (my mother, my father)

We highly recommend just to keep practicing all the pronouns and articles, and then "his/hers" in German will just fall into place!

#### Ideology overload?

This course teaches current standard German.

Currently, mainstream German has not yet found a way to avoid the genderization that is such a central part of European languages. For example, unlike in English ("their") or Swedish ("hen"), there is no gender-neutral pronoun for third person singular in German.

While language is often very conservative (unwilling to change), culture is often much more progressive. This course reflects that. If you are offended by the fact that gay people do not only exist, but are finally a normal part of German life, don't be. We can't change you, but don't try to change reality.

#### Hobbies #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Hobbies/practice) ^

### _Im_ vs. _ins_

For now, think of _im_ as "inside", and "ins" as "into":

*   Ich bin im Theater. (I am inside the theater.)
*   Ich gehe ins Theater. (I go into the theater.)

Later on, you will see these are part of a larger pattern.

_Im_ is also used for months and seasons:

*   Im Juli, im Winter

### Verb forms: you (plural)

So far, you learned these verb forms:


|            |learn |drive |have |
|------------|------|------|-----|
|infinitive  |lernen|fahren|haben|
|ich         |lerne |fahre |habe |
|du (you sg.)|lernst|fährst|hast |
|er/sie/es   |lernt |fährt |hat  |
|wir         |lernen|fahren|haben|
|sie         |lernen|fahren|haben|


Here you learn the form for the last person, "you (plural)".

This form always has a "-t" ending, and the stem of the verb will always be the same as the infinitive. Contrast with the third person singular, where there may be stem changes:


|             |learn |drive |have |
|-------------|------|------|-----|
|infinitive   |lernen|fahren|haben|

|ihr (you pl.)|lernt |fahrt |habt |


### _Gern_

In English, you can say:

*   I like chocolate. I like to swim.

Previously, you learned "mögen" means "to like":

*   Ich mag Schokolade.

However, this can only be used with nouns. For verbs, there is a structure that English does not use. It is therefore often confusing for beginners of German.

*   Ich schwimme _gern_.

_Gern_ is an adverb, not a verb. Literally, Germans say "I swim likingly." Here's a tip: If you know where in the sentence to put "oft" (often), you know where to put "gern":

*   Ich gehe _oft_ ins Theater. (I often go to the theater.)
*   Ich gehe _gern_ ins Theater. (I like to go to the theater.)

_Gern_ may be written/spoken as _gerne_, these two forms are exactly the same.

#### Questions #4 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Questions/practice) ^

#### Yes/No Questions

Questions can be asked by switching the subject and verb. For instance, "Du verstehst das." (You understand this) becomes "Verstehst du das?" (Do you understand this?). These kinds of questions will generally just elicit yes/no answers. In English, the main verb "to be" follows the same principle. "I am hungry." becomes "Am I hungry?". In German, all verbs follow this principle. There's no do-support.

#### Asking a Question in German With a W-Word

Six W-questions - "Wer" (Who), "Was" (What), "Wo" (Where), "Wann" (When), "Warum" (Why) and "Wie" (How) - can be asked in German to elicit more than yes/no answers. Two of the six adverbs are declineable (i.e. change with the case), whereas four are not.

#### Wer (Who)

"Wer" is declinable and needs to adjust to the four cases. The adjustment depends on what the question is targeting.

1.  If you ask for the subject of a sentence (i.e. the nominative object), "wer" (who) remains as is: "Wer sitzt da?" (Who is sitting there?).
2.  If you ask for the direct (accusative) object in a sentence, "wer" changes to "wen" (who/whom). As a mnemonic, notice how "wen" sounds similar to "den" in "den Apfel." "Wen siehst du?" (Whom do you see?) - "Ich sehe den Sohn" (I see the son).
3.  If you ask for the indirect object, "wer" changes to "wem" (who/to whom) and adjusts to the dative case. You could ask "Wem hast du den Apfel gegeben?" (To whom did you give the apple?) and the answer could be "Dem Mann" (the man). Notice again how the declined form of "wer" ("wem") sounds like the definite article of all masculine and neuter nouns in the dative case (like "dem Mann" or "dem Kind").
4.  Lastly, asking about ownership (genitive case), changes "wer" to "wessen" (whose). "Wessen Schuhe sind das?" (Whose shoes are these?) - "Das sind die Schuhe des Jungen" (These are the boy’s shoes). And notice once again how "wessen" (of the) and "des" (of the) include a lot of s-sounds.

#### Was (What)

Similar to the changes made to "wer," "was" will decline depending on the four cases.

1.  For both the nominative and accusative cases, "was" remains the same. It is common to ask "Wer oder was?" (who or what?), if you want to know more about the nominative object and do not know if it is a person (who) or a thing (what). You ask "Wen oder was?" (who/whom or what?), if you want to know more about the accusative object.
2.  "Was" changes to "wessen" for questions about the genitive object as in "Wessen ist sie schuldig?" (What is she guilty of?).
3.  For the dative, "was" changes to a compount of "wo(r)" + preposition. For instance, if the verb takes the German preposition "an" (on/about) as in "an etwas denken," you would ask "Woran denkt er?" (About what is he thinking?). Likewise, "hingehen" is a verb composed of "gehen" + "hin" (go + to) and you would ask "Wohin geht sie?" (To where is she going?).

#### Wo (Where)

In German, you can inquire about locations in several ways. "Wo" (where) is the general question word, but if you are asking for a direction in which someone or something is moving, you may use "wohin" (where to). Look at: "Wo ist mein Schuh?" (Where is my shoe?) and "Wohin kommt dieser Wein?" (Where does this wine go?). Furthermore, "Wohin" is separable into "Wo" + "hin." For example, "Wo ist mein Schuh hin?" (Where did my shoe go?).

Note that the sound of "Wer" is similar to "Where" and that of "Wo" to "Who," but they must not be confused. In other words: the two German questions words "Wer" (Who) and "Wo" (Where) are false cognates to English. They mean the opposite of what an English speaker would think.

#### Wann (When)

"Wann" (when) does not change depending on the case. "Wann" can be used with conjunctions such as "seit" (since) or "bis" (till): "Seit wann haben Sie für Herrn Müller gearbeitet?" (Since when have you been working for Mr. Müller?) and "Bis wann geht der Film?" (Till when does the movie last?).

#### Warum (Why)

"Warum" (why) is also not declinable. "Wieso" and "Weshalb" can be used instead of "Warum." For an example, take "Warum ist das Auto so alt?" = "Wieso ist das Auto so alt?" = "Weshalb ist das Auto so alt?" (Why is that car so old?).

#### Siblings #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Siblings/practice) ^

### Modal verbs

#### Modal verbs have simpler endings

In English, some verbs can be used in **combination with an infinitive**:

*   He can swim. I must sleep.

German is similar:

*   Er kann schwimmen. Ich muss schlafen.

Did you ever notice the _\-s_ (as in _he eats_) does not appear in _he can_? In German, too, the **first and third person are the same** for modal verbs:


|person|modal verb|full verb|
|------|----------|---------|
|ich   |kann      |singe    |
|du    |kannst    |singst   |
|er/sie|kann      |singt    |


#### _Mögen_ vs. _machen_

_Mögen_ (to like) is not a normal modal verb. It can only be used with nouns (or pronouns):

*   Ich mag Pizza. (I like pizza.)
*   Er mag es! (He likes it!)

Its singular forms are:


|        |     |
|--------|-----|
|ich     |mag  |
|du      |magst|
|er / sie|mag  |


_Machen_ is a normal verb. It means _to make_.

*   Ich _mache_ Pizza. (I _make_ Pizza.)

However, it's also used where English used _to do_

*   Das mache ich nicht! ("I don't _do_ that!", literally "That make I not!")

They are easily confused by new learners:

*   Ich mache Pizza! (I make pizza!)
*   Ich mag Pizza! (I like pizza!)

#### To infinity and beyond!

Earlier, you learned an important principle of German sentence structure:

*   The subject-related part of the verb ("ich _singe_, du _singst_, …") will always be in position 2.
*   The "rest" of the verb goes to the end of the sentence.
*   Everything else will go between these two.

This principle is called "sentence bracket".


|1  |2    |…              |end    |
|---|-----|---------------|-------|
|Ich|singe|nicht          |.      |
|Ich|kann |nicht          |singen.|
|Ich|kann |am Montag nicht|singen.|


What does this mean for modal verbs?

*   The **modal verb goes to position 2**.
*   The **infinitive goes to the end of the sentence**.

Many learners find sentence structure hard. Be patient, keep experimenting. At some point, your brain will adapt :)

### Case Alert: _nominative_ vs. _accusative_

#### Me and You

In English, the pronouns sometimes change:

*   _He_ likes _her_. _She_ likes _him_.

This is a leftover from a much more detailed ancient "case system".

German uses quite a bit more of this system, as you will see later on. For now, just consider these forms:


|nominative|accusative|
|----------|----------|
|ich       |mich      |
|du        |dich      |


_Nominative_ and _accusative_ are two of these "cases".

_Nominative_ is used for the sentence's subject.

Accusative has several functions. Here it is used as the object of a sentence:

*   _Ich_ mag _dich_. _Du_ magst _mich_. (_I_ like _you_. _You_ like _me_.)

Some prepositions also will require the _accusative_:

*   Ist der Tee _für mich_? (Is the tea _for me_?)

#### Accusative: Other Forms

There are other words that will change when they are in the _accusative_ case. The good news is, this only happens for words that are _masculine_ (and of course _singular_).

This means, that as long as a noun (and its associated words, such as pronouns or articles) are not _masculine_ and _singular_, **_nominative_ and _accusative_ will be the same**.

*   _Eine_ Frau hat _eine_ Katze. (A woman has a cat.)
*   _Ein_ Kind hat _ein_ Fahrrad. (A child has a bike.)
*   _Die_ Pizza ist für _die_ Frau. (The pizza is for the woman.)

The change for _masculine singular_ is very simple. Just use an _\-en_ ending everywhere:

*   Ein Mann hat ein_en_ Computer. (A man has a computer.)
*   Ich habe kein_en_ Computer. (I have no computer.)
*   Der Euro ist für d_en_ Bus. (The euro is for the bus.)

Consistently, the pronoun for _he_ also gets an _\-n_ ending:

*   _Er_ mag _ihn_. (He likes him.)

_Wer_ (who) also changes in accusative: it will always be _wen_ then (regardless of gender):

*   Wer ist das? (Who is that?)
*   Wen magst du? (Whom do you like?)

### Adjective endings

At the end of a sentence, adjectives do not change their endings:

*   Die Pizza ist gut. (The pizza is good.)
*   Das Eis ist gut. (The ice cream is good.)

In front of nouns, they will have endings that go with the gender, and with the case. For now, just remember these rules:

For feminine and plural, add _\-e_:

*   Das ist ein_e_ gut_e_ Pizza.
*   Ich habe zwei klein_e_ Brüder. (I have two little brothers.)

For masculine/neuter, also add _\-e_, when using _der/das_:

*   Der klein_e_ Bruder (the little brother)
*   Das gut_e_ Eis (the good ice cream).

As a language hack, you might use _\-e_ as the default ending, and learn the exceptions later on.

Here's the first exception: if in masculine accusative (_den/einen_), the adjective also ends in _\-en_

*   Ich habe ein_en_ klein_en_ Bruder. (I have a little brother.)
*   Ich mag d_en_ klein_en_ Mann. (I like the little man.)

#### Animals 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Animals-1/practice) ^

### Recognizing noun gender

While noun genders might seem random for many words, there are quite a few ways to at least land a likely hit.

For example, many German nouns have some kind of ending, which will always or often come with a particular gender.

*   **Non-living objects that end in _\-e_**: these will almost always be **feminine** (_Schokolade, Erdbeere, Orange, Banane, Suppe, …_). One of the very few exceptions is _der Käse_. This also works for many, but not all animals (_die Katze, Ente, Spinne, Biene, Fliege, …_).
    
*   Nouns **beginning with _Ge-_** are often **neuter**. This is the only prefix determining gender. (_das Gemüse, …_)
    

There are many more endings like these. You will learn more about them throughout this course.

### _Fressen_ vs. _essen_

Unlike English, German has two similar but different verbs for "to eat": _essen_ and _fressen_. The latter is the standard way of expressing that an animal is eating something. Be careful **not** to use _fressen_ to refer to humans – this would be a serious insult. Assuming you care about politeness, we will not accept your solutions if you use _fressen_ with human subjects.

The most common way to express that a human being is eating something is the verb _essen_. It is not wrong to use it for animals as well, so we will accept both solutions. But we strongly recommend you accustom yourself to the distinction between _essen_ and _fressen_.

Fortunately, both verbs have the same conjugation:


|essen         |fressen (for animals)|
|--------------|---------------------|
|ich esse      |ich fresse           |
|du isst       |du frisst            |
|er/sie/es isst|er/sie/es frisst     |
|wir essen     |wir fressen          |
|ihr esst      |ihr fresst           |
|sie essen     |sie fressen          |


#### Market #6 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Market/practice) ^

### _Jeder_

For English _every_, German uses _jeder_. However, its ending changes like "der, die, das":


|gender, case  |the|every|
|--------------|---|-----|
|masc. Nom.    |der|jeder|
|neut. Nom/Akk.|das|jedes|
|fem. Nom./Akk.|die|jede |
|masc. Akk.    |den|jeden|
|m/n Dativ     |dem|jedem|
|fem. Dativ    |der|jeder|


Times are in accusative in German:

*   Ich gehe _jeden Tag_ schwimmen.

#### Adjectives: Predicative 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Predicative/practice) ^

### Predicate adjectives

Predicate adjectives, i.e. **adjectives that don't precede a noun, are not inflected**.

*   Der Mann ist _groß_.
*   Die Männer sind _groß_.
*   Die Frau ist _groß_.
*   Die Frauen sind _groß_.
*   Das Haus ist _groß_.
*   Die Häuser sind _groß_.

As you can see, the adjective remains in the base form, regardless of number and gender.

"D'uh", you say? Keep digging into the German skills tree, and you will soon find the deeper reality of German adjectives :)

#### Negative and positive statements #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Not/practice) ^

### German Negatives - _nicht_

There are different ways to negate expressions in German (much like in English you can use "no" in some cases, and "does not" in others). The German adverb _nicht_ (not) is used very often, but sometimes you need to use _kein_ (not a). _Kein_ will be taught in a later lesson.

**Use _nicht_** in the following situations:

#### _Nicht_ + definite article

_Nicht_ negates a **noun that has a definite article**:

*   Das ist **nicht** _der Junge_. (That is not the boy.)

#### _Nicht_ + possessive pronoun

_Nicht_ negates a **noun that has a possessive pronoun**:

*   Das ist **nicht** _mein Glas_. (That is not my glass.)

#### _Nicht_ negates a verb

When negating a verb, use _nicht_.

*   Ich _trinke_ **nicht**. (I do not drink.)

**Why does the _nicht_ appear at the end here?**

Refer to the section "Position of _nicht_" below to find the answer.

#### _Nicht_ negates an adverb

_Nicht_ appears before an **adverb or adverbial phrase**:

*   Ich tanze **nicht** _oft_. (I don't dance often.)

#### _Nicht_ negates an adjective at the end of a sentence

When an adjective is part of a verb, also use _nicht_.

*   Du bist **nicht** _hungrig_. (You are not hungry.)

The infinitive here is _hungrig sein_ (to be hungry).

#### Position of _Nicht_

Adverbs end up in different places in different languages. You cannot simply place the German adverb _nicht_ where you would put "not" in English.

The general rule is:

**_Nicht_ appears before the item it negates.**

*   Du bist **nicht** _hungrig_. (not _hungry_)
*   Ich tanze **nicht** _oft_. (not _often_)
*   Das ist **nicht** _mein Glas_. (not _my glass_)
*   Das ist **nicht** _der Junge_. (not _the boy_)

So, what about _Ich trinke nicht_?

#### ♫ The German Sentence Bracket ♫

Consider this English sentence:

*   I _wake up_ in China.

The verb would be "wake up", the infinitive "to wake up". English keeps its verb elements close together. German, on the other hand, has a peculiar sentence structure:

*   Ich _wache_ in China _auf_.

The infinitive here is _auf|wachen_. German will normally put the last element of the infinitive (the part that changes with the person) in position 2 of the sentence. Everything else will end up at the very end. The rest of the sentence (for example, adverbs), will appear between this "sentence bracket".

Here's a longer example:

*   Infinitive: _mit Freunden ins Restaurant **gehen**_ (to _go_ to the restaurant with friends)
    
*   Ich _gehe_ mit Freunden ins Restaurant.
    

If you're confused now, don't worry :) This will become clearer as you get lots of practice throughout this course.

Why are we telling you this here? This bracket is the reason _nicht_ might end up at the end of a sentence.

Consider these examples:

*   Ich lerne Deutsch. (I learn German.) — _Deutsch lernen_ (to _learn German_)
*   Ich trinke Bier. (I drink beer.) — _Bier trinken_ (to _drink beer_)
*   Ich trinke nicht. — _nicht trinken_ ("to _not drink_")

**This skill contains both negative and positive statements.**

#### Complain #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Complain/practice) ^

### Verb forms: to be

As mentioned earlier, as in English, "sein" (to be) is highly irregular. Here are the complete verb forms for the present tense:


|         |         |    |
|---------|---------|----|
|to be    |         |sein|
|I        |ich      |bin |
|you (sg.)|du       |bist|
|he/she/it|er/sie/es|ist |
|we       |wir      |sind|
|you (pl.)|ihr      |seid|
|they     |sie      |sind|


Note that the first and third person plural are still the same.

### Verb forms: modal verbs

As mentioned earlier, modal verbs have their own rule set.

They often have a different vowel in singular than in plural.

Also, the first and third person singular are the same.


|person   |can   |
|---------|------|
|ich      |kann  |
|du       |kannst|
|er/sie/es|kann  |
|wir      |können|
|ihr      |könnt |
|sie      |können|


As in English, they are usually combined with an infinitive form:

*   Ich kann nicht _schwimmen_! (I cannot swim!)

### Imperative: you (plural)

The imperative for plural is easy:

*   Ihr trinkt kein Bier. (You drink no beer.)
*   Trinkt kein Bier! (Drink no beer!)

As in English, just omit the pronoun.

### Too many _ihr_?

The word _ihr_ has several functions in German:


|         |                           |
|---------|---------------------------|
|her      |ihr Bier (her beer)        |
|their    |ihr Bier (their beer)      |
|you (pl.)|ihr trinkt (you guys drink)|


Don't worry too much about this, context normally shows you which one is which.

### _Finden_

_Finden_ can just mean "to find":

*   Ich kann mein Handy nicht finden! (I cannot find my mobile phone!)

It is also used to express opinions:

*   Ich finde den Film gut. ("I like the movie.", literally "I find the movie good.)

Note that the object is in the accusative case.

### _Tut mir leid!_

Learn _tut mir leid_ like one word, the grammar is irregular. It roughly corresponds to English "I am sorry", meaning that you feel regret or empathy.

#### Questions and statements #6 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/questions-1/practice) ^

### Yes/No Questions

When **asking a yes/no question** in English, you would say:

*   "**Is** it cold?", but
*   "**Do** you **have** a dog?" or
*   "**Does** the man **drink** water?".

German will not use "do" here. We will **switch subject and verb for all verbs**.

*   **Ist** es kalt?
*   **Hast** du einen Hund?
*   **Trinkt** der Mann Wasser?

_This skill contains both questions and statements._

#### Leisure #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Leisure/practice) ^

### Dative plural: "n" all the way!

Remember that the ending for articles, pronouns and adjectives is _\-n_ in dative plural:

*   mit de_n_ alte_n_ Autos (with the old cars)

In addition, plural nouns that do not end in _\-n_ already will also get an _\-n_:

*   der Freund, die Freunde (the friend, the friends)
*   mit meine_n_ alte_n_ Freunde_n_ (with my old friends)

As you can see above, _\-s_ plural endings break this rule.

#### Verbs: Present 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Present-1/practice) ^

### No continuous aspect

Remember that in German, there's no continuous aspect, i.e. there are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: _Ich trinke._

There's no such thing as _Ich bin trinke_ or _Ich bin trinken!_

### Verb conjugation

#### Conjugating regular verbs

Here again is the complete table for conjugating regular verbs:

Example: _gehen_ (to go)


|English person    |German example|
|------------------|--------------|
|I                 |ich gehe      |
|you (sg. informal)|du gehst      |
|he/she/it         |er/sie/es geht|
|we                |wir gehen     |
|you (pl. informal)|ihr geht      |
|they              |sie gehen     |


Notice that the **1st and the 3rd person plural have the same ending**.

The _\-h-_ in _gehen_ tells you that the _\-e-_ before it will have a "long" pronunciation. It is not pronounced!

#### Vowel change in some verbs

A few common verbs change the vowel in the **second and third person singular**.

Normally the vowel will change:

*   from _a_ to _ä_
*   from _e_ to _i(e)_


|person   |schlafen|sehen |
|---------|--------|------|
|ich      |schlafe |sehe  |
|du       |schläfst|siehst|
|er/sie/es|schläft |sieht |
|wir      |schlafen|sehen |
|ihr      |schlaft |seht  |
|sie      |schlafen|sehen |


Other verbs in this skill are

*   fahren (to ride) — du f**äh**rst
*   waschen (to wash) — du w**ä**schst

In addition, when a **verb stem ends in _\-s_**, _second and third person singular_ forms will look the same:

*   lesen (to read) — du **liest**, er **liest**

This is because the _\-s-_ from _du …-st_ and the _\-s_ from the verb stem merge.

#### _Wollen_ and _mögen_

_Wollen_ (to want) and _mögen_ (to like) follow a different conjugation system:


|English       |pronoun  |wollen|mögen|
|--------------|---------|------|-----|
|I want/like   |ich      |will  |mag  |
|you (sg. inf.)|du       |willst|magst|
|he/she/it     |er/sie/es|will  |mag  |
|we            |wir      |wollen|mögen|
|you (pl. inf.)|ihr      |wollt |mögt |
|they          |sie      |wollen|mögen|


Notice that here, the first and third person are the same (plural **and** singular). The vowel in singular is different from the vowel in plural.

### How do you like things in German?

Use the verb _mögen_ to express that you **like something or someone**.

**_Mögen_ cannot be used for verbs!**

In a later lesson, you will learn to **use the adverb gern(e) _to express that you like_ doing\* something**.

(The similar verb _möchten_ can be followed by a verb, but _Ich möchte Fußball spielen_ translates as "I _would like to_ play soccer", not "I _like_ playing soccer".)

#### _Mögen_ is used for things, animals, and people:

*   Ich _mag_ Bier. (I like beer.)
    
*   Sie _mag_ Katzen. (She likes cats.)
    
*   Wir _mögen_ dich. (We like you.)
    
*   Ihr _mögt_ Bücher. (You like books.)
    

#### Nature 1 #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Nature-1/practice) ^

### Lakes and seas - false friends ahoy!

The German for "the lake" is _der See_ (masculine) and the most commonly used word for "the sea" is _das Meer_ (neuter).

There's another slightly less commonly used word for "the sea": _die See_ (feminine).

Be careful not to confuse _der See_ (the lake) and _die See_ (the sea). Remember that when you learn a noun, you should always learn the gender with it.


|singular  |(masc.: "lake")|(fem.: "sea")|
|----------|---------------|-------------|
|nominative|der See        |die See      |
|accusative|den See        |die See      |


The plural forms are identical (only the plural of _der See_ is commonly used).


|plural    |(masc.: "lakes")|(fem.: "seas")|
|----------|----------------|--------------|
|nominative|die Seen        |die Seen      |
|accusative|die Seen        |die Seen      |


There are not many noun pairs like this in German. Here is the most extreme example, with plural forms:

*   _das_ Band (die Bänder) - the tape (band)
*   _der_ Band (die Bände) - the volume/tome
*   _die_ Band (pronounced as in English) (die Bands) - the music band

#### Shopping #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Shopping/practice) ^

### _Kaufen_ vs. _einkaufen_

_Kaufen_ is normally used in the meaning of "to buy":

*   Ich **kaufe** einen Hut.

_Einkaufen_ is normally used without an object, and often refers to shopping. It can be used in conjunction with _gehen_:

*   Ich _kaufe_ im Supermarkt _ein_. (I shop in the supermarket)
*   Wann gehst du _einkaufen_? (When do you go shopping?)

_Verkaufen_ means "to sell". The prefix _ver-_ is often associated with an "away" notion.

### _Laden, Geschäft_

A variety of words exist for "shop". These are two common ones, with roughly exchangeable usage.

#### Travel #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Travel/practice) ^

#### Sehenswürdigkeiten?!

The word _Sehenswürdigkeit_ (_sight_ as in _sightseeing_) is made up of several meaningful parts: _sehen_ + _s_ + _würdig_ + _keit_.

Let's look at each part and its meaning.


|Part  |Meaning           |
|------|------------------|
|sehen |to see            |
|-s-   |connecting element|
|würdig|to be worthy      |
|-keit |noun suffix       |


Literally _Sehenswürdigkeit_ means _something which is worthy to see_.

The connecting element _\-s-_ is used to link words together.

The ending _\-keit_ turns an adjective into a noun.

Often the ending of a compound noun is a good indicator for the gender of the noun. For example, if a noun ends in _\-keit_, it will always be feminine (die).

#### _Urlaub_ vs. _Ferien_

Just like in English there's "holidays" and "vacation", in German there are _Ferien_ and _Urlaub_. They can be used interchangeably to some extent.

_Ferien_ only exists as a plural noun:

*   Die Ferien sind im Sommer. (The holidays are in summer.)

_Urlaub_ only exists as a singular noun:

*   Wann ist der Urlaub? (When is the vacation?)

#### _Visum_

In English, you need "a visa". In German, the singular is _das Visum_, _Visa_ is the plural (as it is in Latin, the source language of this word).

#### _Weg_ vs. _weg_

_Der Weg_ (with a long _\-e-_) roughly means "the path".

*   Der Weg ist lang. (The path is long.)

The word _weg_ (with a short, open _\-e-_) roughly means "away". Here are some examples:

*   Geh _weg_! (Go away!)
*   Ich bin _weg_! (I'm gone!)

#### Classroom #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Classroom/practice) ^

### Verbs ending in _\-ieren_

There is a large number of verbs that end in _\-ieren_. These are usually actions. Often, you can just look at the word stem (before _\-ieren_) and guess the meaning from English:

*   notieren (to note down)
*   markieren (to mark)
*   telefonieren (to talk on the phone)
*   studieren (to study at university)

This group is completely regular: all verbs in this group will behave in the same way. They differ from other verbs in one way: regardless of how long the verb is, the _\-ie-_ part will always carry the stress:

*   Mein Bruder telefon**ier**t. (My brother is talking on the phone.)
*   Wir stud**ier**en hier. (We study here.)

### Number one

Remember that numbers don't change endings in German. The single exception is _eins_ (one).

When used on its own, say _eins_. In combination with nouns, the _\-s_ gets lost, and there might be additional ending changes.

*   Ich komme um ein_s_! (I arrive at one!)
*   Ich komme um ein Uhr. (I arrive at one o'clock.)
*   Ich habe ein_e_ Frage. (I have a/one question.)

#### Possessive Pronouns #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Possessive-Pronouns/practice) ^

### Personal Pronouns in the Nominative Case

A pronoun is a word that represents a noun, like _er_ does for _der Mann_. In the nominative case, the personal pronouns are simply the grammatical persons you already know: _ich_, _du_, _er/sie/es_, _wir_, _ihr_, and _sie_.

#### Possessive pronouns

German uses possessive pronouns similar to the English ones. For example "my" is _mein_ in German, "his" is _sein_, and "her" is _ihr_.


|personal pronouns|possessive pronouns|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|ich              |mein               |
|du               |dein               |
|er/es            |sein               |
|sie (feminine)   |ihr                |
|wir              |unser              |
|ihr              |euer               |
|sie (plural)     |ihr                |


Remember that in German, _eu_ sounds like "b_oy_", and the ending _\-er_ normally roughly sounds like "m_a_".

##### Nominative forms

Unlike English, these possessive pronouns change their endings in the same way as the indefinite article _ein_.

*   mein Bruder (ein Bruder)
*   mein**e** Mutter (ein**e** Mutter)

This is mostly straightforward (just append the correct ending according to the noun). There is a slight irregularity: _euer_ does not become _eu**e**re_, but _eure_ (it loses an internal _\-e-_).

The following table has the forms in the nominative case. These are used for subjects, as in

*   _Meine Katze_ ist super. (My cat is great.)


|              |der Hund|das Insekt|die Katze|die Hunde|
|--------------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
|indef. article|ein     |ein       |eine     |(keine)  |
|ich           |mein    |mein      |meine    |meine    |
|du            |dein    |dein      |deine    |deine    |
|er/es         |sein    |sein      |seine    |seine    |
|sie (fem.)    |ihr     |ihr       |ihre     |ihre     |
|wir           |unser   |unser     |unsere   |unsere   |
|ihr           |euer    |euer      |eure     |eure     |
|sie (plural)  |ihr     |ihr       |ihre     |ihre     |


As you might notice, _ihr_ has several different functions, so make sure you understand the context it is used in.

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns in English are: **this, that, these, and those**. In German, in Nominative and Accusative, the **demonstrative pronouns are the same as the definite articles**.

That means, _der_, _die_ and _das_ can also mean "that (one)" or "this (one)" depending on the gender of the respective noun, and "die" (plural) can mean "these" or "those."

*   **Der** ist komisch! (_That one_ is strange!)
*   Meine Kinder? **Die** sind in England. (My kids? _They/Those_ are in England.)

When spoken, the definite articles can serve a similar function:

*   **Der** Junge liest eine Zeitung, **der** Junge liest ein Buch.
*   _This_ boy is reading a newspaper, _that_ boy is reading a book.

The articles would be stressed in that case.

#### Breakfast #4 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Breakfast/practice) ^

### Perfect tense

As in English, you cannot use the present tense for the past.

Unlike in English, the perfect tense is almost always used. You do not have to think whether the action is relevant to the present or not. Just use the perfect tense.

*   Ich habe Suppe gekocht. (I \[have\] cooked soup.)

Here you will learn how the regular perfect participle forms work: just add _ge-_ in front, and _\-t_ to the stem.


|       |       |
|-------|-------|
|machen |kochen |
|gemacht|gekocht|


Most of the time, German uses "haben" (have) as a helper verb, just like English:

*   Ich habe nichts gemacht! (I have done/did nothing!)

Remember that German sentence structure requires you to put the subject-related part of the verb in position 2, and the rest of the verb to the end:


|1      |2   |…            |end     |
|-------|----|-------------|--------|
|Ich    |habe|gestern Suppe|gekocht.|
|Gestern|habe|ich Suppe    |gekocht.|


### Adverbs at the beginning of the sentence

Remember that you can put many sentence elements at the sentence beginning:

*   Morgen gehe ich ins Theater. (Tomorrow, I go to the theater.)
*   Pizza mag ich nicht. (I do not like pizza.)
*   Normalerweise trinke ich keine Milch. (Normally, I don't drink milk.)

Don't forget that if you do that, the verb will come second! This means that the subject will then be _after_ the verb.

### What comes first?

Generally, German puts the sentence element first that gives the context for the sentence. This is often the part that was stressed in a question before:

*   Was machst du _morgen_? (What are you doing tomorrow?)
*   _Morgen_ gehe ich ins Theater.

Never put the answer to a question in first position.

If in doubt, just start with the subject:

*   Ich gehe morgen ins Theater.

### _Erst_ vs. _nur_

Earlier on you learned that _nur_ means _only_:

*   Ich habe nur einen Sohn. (I have only one son.)

German also has _erst_, which implies that there might be more coming:

*   Ich habe erst einen Sohn. (I have only one son so far.)
*   Ich esse erst Suppe. (I eat soup first.)
*   Er kommt erst am Montag. (He arrives not before Monday.)

#### Nominative Pronouns #2 · 2020-07-30[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Nominative-Pronouns/practice) ^

### Some other pronouns

Some other words can function as pronouns.

The following ones change their endings like definite articles:


|          |der    |das    |
|----------|-------|-------|
|this/these|dieser |dieses |
|every     |jeder  |jedes  |
|some      |mancher|manches|



|die (fem.)|die (pl.)|
|----------|---------|
|diese     |diese    |
|jede      |---      |
|manche    |manche   |


*   _Dieser_ Junge isst, _dieser_ (Junge) trinkt.
*   _This_ boy eats, _that_ (boy/one) drinks.
    
*   _Jedes_ Kind mag Pizza. (_Every_ kid likes pizza.)
    
*   _Manche_ Kinder mögen Käse. (_Some_ kids like cheese.)

### _Viel_ vs. _viele_

These roughly correspond to English "much/many". Use _viel_ with uncountable nouns, _viele_ with countable ones.

*   Ich trinke **viel** Wasser.
*   Ich habe **viele** Hunde.

### _Alles_ oder _nichts_

Just like _nicht_ (not) has a look-alike _nicht**s**_ (nothing), _alle_ (all) has _alle**s**_ (everything) as a counterpart.

*   Ich esse **nicht**. (I do not eat.)
*   Ich esse **nichts**. (I eat nothing.)
*   Ich esse **alles**. (I eat everything.)
*   Ich esse **alle** (Orangen). (I eat all (oranges).)

### _Ein paar_ vs. _ein Paar_

_Ein paar_ (lowercase _p_) means "a few", "some" or "a couple (of)" (only in the sense of **at least two, not exactly two!**).

_Ein Paar_ (uppercase _P_) means "a pair (of)" and is only used for things that typically come in pairs of two, e.g. _ein Paar Schuhe_ (a pair of shoes).

So this is quite similar to English "a couple" (a pair) vs. "a couple of" (some).

### _etwas_ vs. _manche_

Both _etwas_ and _manche_ can be translated as "some" in certain contexts, but they don't have the same meaning.

_etwas_ means "some" before an uncountable noun, when the meaning is "a little bit of, a small quantity of": The following noun is always in the **singular** in this meaning.

*   _etwas Wasser_ (some water, a bit of water)
*   _Hast du etwas Brot?_ (do you have some bread / a bit of bread?)

_manche_ means "some" in the sense of "certain; some but not others" and almost always stands before a **plural** noun

*   _Manche Kinder haben Hunger._ (Some children are hungry \[but others are not\].)
*   _Manche Häuser sind teurer als andere._ (Some houses are more expensive than others.)

#### Negatives #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Negatives/practice) ^

### German Negatives

There are different ways to negate expressions in German (much like in English you can use "no" in some cases, and "does not" in others). The German adverb _nicht_ (not) is used very often, but sometimes you need to use _kein_ (not a).

#### _Nicht_

As mentioned in the lesson "Not", you should use _nicht_ in the following situations:

*   Negating a **noun that has a definite article** like _der Junge_ (the boy) in _Das ist nicht der Junge._ (That is not the boy).
*   Negating a **noun that has a possessive pronoun** like _mein Glas_ (my glass) in _Das ist nicht mein Glas._ (That is not my glass).
*   Negating **the verb**: _Ich **trinke** nicht._ (I do not drink.).
*   Negating **an adverb or adverbial phrase**. For instance, _Ich tanze nicht **oft**._ (I do not dance often)
*   Negating **an adjective that is used with _sein_** (to be): _Ich bin nicht **hungrig**_. (I am not hungry).

For details, and to learn where to put _nicht_ in a sentence, refer to the "Not" lesson.

#### _Kein_

Simply put, **_kein_ is composed of _k + ein_** and placed where the indefinite article would be in a sentence. **If you want to negate _ein_, use _kein_**.

Just like _mein_ and the other possessive pronouns, **_kein_ changes its ending like _ein_**.

For instance, look at the positive and negative statement about these two nouns:

*   Er ist ein Mann. (He is a man) — Sie ist kein Mann. (She is not a/no man.)
*   Ich habe ein_e_ Katze. (I have a cat.) — Ich habe kein_e_ Katze. (I have no cat.)

Here are the endings of the indefinite article so far:


|          |masc |neut|fem |plural|
|----------|-----|----|----|------|
|nominative|ein  |ein |eine|---   |
|accusative|einen|ein |eine|---   |


Here is the list of the respective _kein_ forms:


|          |masc  |neut|fem  |plural|
|----------|------|----|-----|------|
|nominative|kein  |kein|keine|keine |
|accusative|keinen|kein|keine|keine |


_Kein_ is also used for **negating nouns that have no article**: _Er hat Brot._ (He has bread.) versus _Er hat kein Brot._ (He has no bread.).

As a general rule:

*   If you **can use "not a/no" in English, use _kein_**.
*   If you **need to use "not", use _nicht_**.

#### _Nicht_ vs. _Nichts_

_Nicht_ is an adverb and is useful for negations. On the other hand, _nicht**s**_ (nothing/anything) is a pronoun and its meaning is different from that of _nicht_.

*   Ich esse _nicht_. (I do not eat.)
*   Ich esse _nichts_. (I eat nothing.)

Using _nicht_ simply negates a fact, and is less overarching than _nichts_. For example, _Der Schüler lernt nicht._ (The student does not learn.) is less extreme than _Der Schüler lernt nichts._ (The student does not learn anything.).

#### _Keiner, keine, keines_

In German, "nobody" can be expressed in several ways.

As long as it refers to people, _niemand_ works just fine:

*   Niemand schläft. (Nobody sleeps.)

There is also _keiner_. It changes endings like the definite articles:


|          |masc.|neut.|fem.|plural|
|----------|-----|-----|----|------|
|nominative|der  |das  |die |die   |
|accusative|den  |das  |die |die   |



|          |masc. |neut. |fem. |plural|
|----------|------|------|-----|------|
|nominative|keiner|keines|keine|keine |
|accusative|keinen|keines|keine|keine |


For now, we teach only the default version (which is _masculine_ in German):

*   Keiner schläft. (None of them sleeps.)

#### Shop #5 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Shop/practice) ^

### More dative

In some ways, dative is the "easiest" case.

Articles (and related words) follow a simple ending system:


|gender      |ending|
|------------|------|
|feminine    |-r    |
|not feminine|-m    |
|plural      |-n    |


### Dative pronouns

Let's test this with the whole range of pronouns:


|Nom.      |Akk.   |Dat. |
|----------|-------|-----|
|ich       |mich   |mir  |
|du        |dich   |dir  |
|er/es     |ihn/es |ihm  |
|sie (fem.)|sie    |ihr  |
|wir       |uns    |uns  |
|ihr       |euch   |euch |
|sie/Sie   |sie/Sie|ihnen|


As you see, the same rule applies: feminine (sie) becomes _ihr_, _er/es_ become _ihm_, and _sie_ (they) becomes _ihnen_.

Note that for (wir/ihr) (we/plural you), the forms for accusative and dative are the same.

### Dative adjectives

Generally, dative adjectives always end in -en, regardless of gender or number.


|gender|          |adjective|        |English            |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-------------------|
|f     |mit meiner|alten    |Katze   |with my old cat    |
|m/n   |mit meinem|alten    |Hund    |with my old dog    |
|pl    |mit meinen|alten    |Freunden|with my old friends|


### Dative plural nouns

There is one more thing: in dative plural, not only do the article and the adjective end in -n; even the noun itself will get an extra -n, if it does not have one already:

*   der Freund, die Freunde (the friend, the friends)
*   mit mein_en_ gut_en_ Freunde_n_ (with my good friends)

Of course, plurals ending in -s do not conform to this rule.

### Contracted prepositions

Now you can understand why some nouns use _zur_, but others _zum_. These are contractions of "zu der" + "zu dem". Feminine nouns use the former, others the latter.

*   Ich fahre _zum_ Zoo. (I drive to the zoo) > "der Zoo" (m)
*   Ich fahre _zur_ Oper. (I drive to the opera) > "die Oper" (f)

German has some other contractions like this. So far you learned these:

*   im (in dem)
*   ins (in das)

#### Places 1 #6 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Places-1/practice) ^

### Recognizing noun gender

As mentioned before, you can often know the **gender of a noun** by **looking at the word ending**.

*   non-living objects that end in _\-e_: these will almost always be feminine (_die Lampe, Schokolade, Erdbeere, Orange, Banane, Suppe, Hose, Jacke, Sonne, Straße, Brücke, Schule, …_)
*   nouns beginning with _Ge-_ are often neuter. This is the only prefix determining gender. (_das Gebäude, Gemüse, Gesicht, Gesetz, …_)

In addition, rhyming can often help. If you already know a noun that rhymes with the new one, there's a good chance they will have the same gender. Go for it :)

*   der Fisch, der Tisch
*   der Raum, der Traum, der Baum
*   der Kopf, der Knopf

### Pronunciation of French loanwords

When English uses a word from French, it usually pronounces it according to English sound rules. German will often sound more close to the original.

An example for this is _Restaurant_. Like in French, the last syllable will sound roughly like "raw". The _\-t_ will be silent. Some people will pronounce the ending similar to English "rung" instead. Of course, the _R-_ will sound like the German _r_, not the English one.

#### Languages #3 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Languages/practice) ^

### Perfect tense: no _ge-_

Remember that the standard way to create the perfect participle is to add _ge-_ to the beginning of the verb stem, and _\-t_ to the end:

*   machen > ge_mach_t
*   kaufen > ge_kauf_t

Verbs that do not have the stress on the first syllable do not get a _ge-_ in the beginning.

There are two classes of these. First, it includes all verbs ending in _\-ieren_, as these are stressed on the _\-ie-_:

*   markieren > er hat markiert
*   telefonieren > er hat telefoniert

The other one you will encounter in the next skill.

Notice that these look like the third person singular, but they are not:

*   Er markiert (present tense, third person)
*   Ich habe markiert (perfect tense, first person)

#### Stuff #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Stuff/practice) ^

### Combining stuff

German is well known for its long words that can be made up on the go by concatenating existing words. In this skill you will learn one very simple and commonly used way of forming compounds: adding _\-zeug_ (="stuff") to existing words.

Remember that the last element determines gender and plural. So all new words in this lesson will be neuter.

OK, because you asked: the longest "real" German word (so far) is:

*   Rindfleisch-etikettierungs-überwachungs-aufgaben-übertragungs-gesetz

(Without the hyphens. We had to add those in order to be able to show the whole word…)

It's a law on how to transfer tasks about the monitoring of the labeling of beef. At least that's what the word says.

If you enjoyed this, check out "Rhabarberbarbara" on Youtube.

No, words like this don't normally happen in German :)

### How much stuff?

In English, you can't count "stuff" -- you can't use the plural "stuffs" or say that "there are three stuffs on the floor". Instead, "stuff" is a collective noun, referring to a group of things but used in the singular: "there is stuff on the floor".

Some German _\-zeug_ words can work like this as well -- for example, _Spielzeug_ and _Werkzeug_ in the singular, without an article, mean "toys" and "tools", which are plural in English.

Those words can also be used in a countable way: _ein Spielzeug, zwei Werkzeuge_ "one toy, two tools". So "the tools" could be either _das Werkzeug_ or _die Werkzeuge_ -- the former would view the tools as a group, the latter would consider them individually.

Look out for whether there is an indefinite article or number before the singular word to see whether it's used countably or uncountably.

If there's a possessive word or a definite article before such a noun in the singular, it could be either: _mein Werkzeug ist neu_ could mean either "My tool is new" or "My tools are new", for example; similarly with _das Werkzeug ist neu_ which could be either "The tool is new" or "The tools are new".

(An English word that works similarly is "fruit" -- "my fruit" could refer to just one apple, or it could refer to two apples and a banana all together, depending on whether "fruit" is used countably or uncountably.)

Other _\-zeug_ words are always regular countable words, such as _Flugzeug_ "airplane" or _Feuerzeug_ "lighter".

#### Holiday #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Holiday/practice) ^

### Perfect tense: no _ge-_

In the Languages skill, you learned that verbs ending in _\-ieren_ do not get a _ge-_ prefix in the perfect tense:

*   markieren > er hat markiert
*   telefonieren > er hat telefoniert

The reason is that the first syllable of the verb is not stressed.

There is another group of verbs like this. These end in any one of the following unstressed prefixes:

*   be-, er-, ver-, zer-, ent-

Note the difference between _kaufen_ ("to buy", first syllable stressed) and _verkaufen_ ("to sell", first syllable not stressed):

*   Ich kaufe. Ich habe _ge_kauf_t_. (I buy. I bought.)
*   Ich verkaufe. Ich habe _ver_kauf_t_. (I sell. I sold.)

As in English, perfect participles do not change, regardless of person:

*   Ich habe verkauft. Er hat verkauft. Wir haben verkauft.

### Who?

"Who?" has three forms in German, according to case. These have the same endings as the masculine "the". But of course, they work for all genders, and plural:


|Case      |who?|the (masc.)|   |
|----------|----|-----------|---|
|Nominative|wer |der        |I  |
|Accusative|wen |den        |II |
|Dative    |wem |dem        |III|


Note how the number of legs of the last letter neatly align with I, II, III :)

### North, South, …

Use _Norden, Süden, Osten, Westen_ when talking about a place within another place:

*   Hamburg ist im Norden von Deutschland. (Hamburg is in the northern part of Germany.)

Use _nördlich, südlich, östlich, westlich_ when talking about a place relative to another:

*   Dänemark ist nördlich von Deutschland. (Denmark is to the north of Germany.)

### _in der Schweiz_

Most place names don't have an article (they happen to be neuter, but that's mostly irrelevant):

*   Ich bin in Köln. Italien ist schön.

When talking about a direction, these use _nach_:

*   Ich fahre nach Köln. (I go to Cologne.)

A few place names do have an article:

*   die Türkei, die Schweiz (fem.)
*   der Iran, der Irak (masc.)
*   die USA, die Philippinen (plural)

You cannot use _nach_ with those. Instead, use "in + accusative":

*   Ich fahre _in die_ USA. Ich fliege _in den_ Iran.

When talking about being in a location, you will use the dative versions:

*   Ich bin _in der_ Schweiz. Ich bin _in den_ USA.

You will learn more about this dative/accusative switch in the later skill "Furniture".

#### People #5 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/People/practice) ^

### _N-declension_

In general, nouns have two forms, singular and plural:

*   der Hund, die Hunde
*   die Katze, die Katzen

In dative plural, all nouns that do not already have an _\-n_ ending get one:

*   die Hunde, mit den Hunde_n_
*   but: die Katzen, mit den Katzen
*   the exception are plurals ending in "-s": die Autos, mit den Autos

In this skill, you encounter a special all-masculine noun group. These will have an _\-en_ ending in _all forms_, except for the nominative singular (the dictionary form):

*   Der Junge ist nett. Ich kenne einen Jung_en_.

This group includes:

*   almost all masculine nouns that end in _\-e_ (Junge, Name, Kollege, Türke, …)
*   nouns ending in _\-ist_, _\-ent_ and some other endings
*   a small group of other masculine nouns.

Here is an example table for _der Junge_ (the boy):


|Case      |Singular  |Plural    |
|----------|----------|----------|
|Nominative|der Junge |die Jungen|
|Accusative|den Jungen|die Jungen|
|Dative    |dem Jungen|den Jungen|


### _Adjectival nouns_

There is one last group of irregular nouns. These are actually adjectives that became nouns, but keep their rich set of adjective endings. As long as you know the adjective endings, these are straightforward to use:


|Adjective               |Noun               |
|------------------------|-------------------|
|ein deutscher Mann      |ein Deutscher      |
|der deutsche Mann       |der Deutsche       |
|eine deutsche Frau      |eine Deutsche      |
|mit einer deutschen Frau|mit einer Deutschen|


Refer to the _Clothes_ skill for an overview of the adjective endings.

In this skill, you encounter:


|Adjective         |Adj. noun (masc. sg.)   |
|------------------|------------------------|
|deutsch (German)  |Deutscher (German)      |
|erwachsen (adult) |Erwachsener (adult)     |
|verwandt (related)|Verwandter (relative)   |
|bekannt (known)   |Bekannter (acquaintance)|


#### Accusative Pronouns #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Accusative-Pronouns/practice) ^

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns in the Accusative Case

Aside from the nominative case, most of the German **pronouns are declined** according to case. Like in English, when the **subject becomes the object**, **the pronoun changes**. For instance, _ich_ changes to _mich_ (accusative object) as in _Sie sieht mich._ (She sees me.).


|Nominative (subject)      |Accusative (object)         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
|ich (I)                   |mich (me)                   |
|du (you singular informal)|dich (you singular informal)|
|er (he) sie (she) es (it) |ihn (him) sie (her) es (it) |
|wir (we)                  |uns (us)                    |
|ihr (you plural informal) |euch (you plural informal)  |
|sie (they)                |sie (them)                  |


Notice that apart from masculine singular, the **third person forms are the same** in nominative and accusative. The masculine form, which does change, has the same endings as the definite article (_de**r**_ becomes _de**n**_).

#### Possessive Pronouns in the Accusative Case

You might remember from the lesson "Personal Pronouns" that German possessive pronouns change their endings like the indefinite article:

*   _ein_ Hund, _mein_ Hund
*   _eine_ Katze, _meine_ Katze

This extends to all cases. You already know that **in the accusative case, only masculine singular changes**:

*   **Ein** Hund schläft. Er sieht **einen** Hund.

but:

*   **Eine** Katze schläft. Sie sieht **eine** Katze. (no change)

So, if you see _ein**en**_, _mein**en**_, _unser**en**_ and so forth with a singular noun, you will know two things:

*   the noun is masculine
*   the noun is in the accusative case (probably the object of the sentence)

Consider this example:

*   Meinen Hund mag die Frau nicht.

It is clear here that the dog must be the object (accusative). So actually the woman does not like the dog.

Here is the table of possessive pronouns for the accusative case:


|Accusative    |der Hund|das Insekt|die Katze|die Hunde|
|--------------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
|indef. article|einen   |ein       |eine     |(keine)  |
|ich           |meinen  |mein      |meine    |meine    |
|du            |deinen  |dein      |deine    |deine    |
|er/es         |seinen  |sein      |seine    |seine    |
|sie (fem.)    |ihren   |ihr       |ihre     |ihre     |
|wir           |unseren |unser     |unsere   |unsere   |
|ihr           |euren   |euer      |eure     |eure     |
|sie (plural)  |ihren   |ihr       |ihre     |ihre     |


### Other declining words

#### _Viel_ vs. _viele_

These roughly correspond to English "much/many". Use _viel_ with uncountable nouns, _viele_ with countable ones.

*   Ich trinke **viel** Wasser.
*   Ich habe **viele** Hunde.

_Viele_ changes endings like the articles. But because the plural forms are the same for nominative and accusative, for now it will look always the same.

#### _Jeder_

_Jeder_ changes endings like definite articles:

*   die Frau, jede Frau
*   das Mädchen, jedes Mädchen
*   der Mann, jeder Mann — de**n** Mann, jede**n** Mann (accusative)

#### Household 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Household/practice) ^

#### Möbel

_Möbel_ corresponds to English "furniture". While "furniture" is singular, _Möbel_ is normally only used in the plural.

*   Die Möbel sind super! (The furniture is great!)

#### Conjunctions #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Conjunctions/practice) ^

### German Conjunctions

A conjunction like _wenn_ (when) or _und_ (and) connects two parts of a sentence together.

#### Coordinating conjunctions

**Coordinating conjunctions** form a group of coordinators (like _und_ (and), _aber_ (but)), which combine two items of equal importance; here, each clause can stand on its own and the word order does not change.

*   Ich mag Schokolade. Sie mag Pizza.
*   Ich mag Schokolade **und** sie mag Pizza.

Examples: _und, oder, aber, denn_

#### Subordinating conjunctions

**Subordinating conjunctions** combine an independent clause with a dependent clause; the dependent clause cannot stand on its own and its word order will be different than if it did. In these **subordinate clauses**, the verb switches from the second position to the last.

*   Ich bin gesund. Ich **laufe** oft.
*   Ich bin gesund, **weil** ich oft **laufe**.
    
*   Ich spreche gut Deutsch. Ich **lerne** oft Deutsch.
    
*   Ich spreche gut Deutsch, **weil** ich oft Deutsch **lerne**.

Examples: _weil, wenn, dass, obwohl_

#### Correlative conjunctions

**Correlative conjunctions** work in pairs to join sentence parts of equal importance. For instance, _entweder...oder_ (either...or) is such a pair and can be used like this: _Der Schuh ist entweder blau oder rot._ (This shoe is either blue or red.).

In German, conjunctions do not change with the case (i.e. they are not declinable).

*   Du trägst einen Rock. Du trägst eine Hose.
*   Du trägst **entweder** einen Rock **oder** eine Hose.
    
*   Du wäschst den Rock. Du trägst eine Hose.
    
*   **Entweder** du wäschst den Rock, **oder** du trägst eine Hose.
*   Du wäschst **entweder** den Rock **oder** (du) trägst eine Hose.

Examples: _entweder … oder, nicht nur … sondern auch, weder … noch_

#### Sondern

_Sondern_ works like "but … instead" in English. It only takes the element that is different:

*   Ich trage _kein Kleid_. Ich trage _eine Hose_.
*   Ich trage _kein Kleid_, _**sondern** eine Hose_.
    
*   Sie kommt nicht _aus Deutschland_. Sie kommt _aus China_.
    
*   Sie kommt nicht _aus Deutschland_, _**sondern** aus China_.

#### School 1 #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/School-1/practice) ^

### Adjectives: Plural + article

Here are the nominative adjective endings you've learned so far:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|fem.  |die    |alte     |Frau  |
|fem.  |eine   |alte     |Frau  |
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann  |
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind  |
|pl.   |—      |alte     |Männer|


*   Die alte Frau und der alte Mann tanzen.

Remember that in accusative, only masculine changes:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|masc. |den    |alten    |Mann|
|masc. |einen  |alten    |Mann|


*   Ich sehe einen alten Mann.

Also, dative adjectives will always (so far) end in _\-en_:


|gender     |article|adjective|noun     |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
|fem.       |der    |alten    |Frau     |
|fem.       |einer  |alten    |Frau     |
|masc./neut.|dem    |kleinen  |Mann/Kind|
|masc./neut.|einem  |kleinen  |Mann/Kind|
|pl.        |den    |alten    |Männern  |
|pl.        |—      |alten    |Männern  |


In later skills, you will complete this system.

Here you learn that when you add an article in plural (nominative or accusative), you also have to add an _\-n_ to the adjective:


|article|adjective|noun  |
|-------|---------|------|
|—      |alte     |Hunde |
|die    |alten    |Hunde |
|meine  |alten    |Hunde |
|keine  |alten    |Hunde |
|welche |alten    |Hunde?|
|diese  |alten    |Hunde |


Note that besides articles, some other article-like words will have the same effect (pronouns, keine, welche, diese).

### A second group of perfect participles

So far, you learned that perfect participles

*   end in _\-t_
*   normally have a _ge-_ prefix
*   but not when the first syllable is not stressed
    
*   **kauf**en, gekauft
    
*   ver**kauf**en, verkauft
*   telefon**ier**en, telefoniert

Most verbs act like this. However, there is an old group of very common verbs, which shows two differences.

Their perfect participles

*   end in _\-en_
*   might have a vowel (or other) change in the verb stem
    
*   fahren > gefahren, schlafen > geschlafen
    
*   schwimmen > geschwommen, fliegen > geflogen

Otherwise, they behave like the other group: if their first syllable is unstressed, they lose the _ge-_:

*   vergessen > vergessen (forget)

Thus, these might be confused with infinitives.

*   Ich möchte ihn _vergessen_. (I would like to _forget_ him.)
*   Ich _habe_ es _vergessen_. (I _have forgotten_ it.)

The latter group is called "strong verbs", the former (more abundant, regular one) "weak verbs".

### _Wollen_

The modal verb _wollen_ means "to want":

*   Ich will tanzen! (I want to dance!)

Do not confuse it with the English verb "will".

As a modal verb, it follows their rules:

*   the stem vowel is different in singular and plural
*   the first and third person are the same in singular.


|person   |wollen|
|---------|------|
|ich      |will  |
|du       |willst|
|er/sie/es|will  |
|wir      |wollen|
|ihr      |wollt |
|sie/Sie  |wollen|


#### People 1 #7 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/People-1/practice) ^

### Leute

In English, you refer to one "person", but multiple "people". In German, _Leute_ is also only used in the plural. The singular is _eine Person_.

### Ich bin Türke. Ich komme aus Berlin.

Germany has many Turkish people. These are not necessarily from Turkey. Most have had their parents or even their grandparents born in Germany.

#### Furniture #5 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Furniture/practice) ^

### Location

Earlier, you might have wondered about the following:

*   Ich gehe ins Kino. (I go to the cinema.)
*   Ich bin im Kino. (I am in the cinema.)

Here's what's happening: for a range of prepositions, the accusative case indicates location change, while the dative case indicates the location stays the same:

*   in, auf, unter, über, an, neben, vor, hinter, zwischen

In this skill, you'll only encounter sentences without location change. In the next skill, you can practice both.

### Liegen, stehen, …

English usually uses "to be" to describe position:

*   The book is on the table. The bottle is under the chair.

German distinguishes between the following:


|German|English|
|------|-------|
|stehen|stand  |
|sitzen|sit    |
|liegen|lie    |
|hängen|hang   |


Sometimes, these are straightforward:

*   Der Mann sitzt auf dem Stuhl. (The man is sitting on the chair.)

Sometimes, you have to consider whether an object is more vertical (standing) or horizontal (lying):

*   Das Buch liegt auf dem Tisch. (flat on the table)
*   Das Buch steht auf dem Tisch. (upright)

#### Do it! #3 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Do-it!/practice) ^

### Location and location change

In the last skill, you saw that when describing a position, the preposition generally takes the dative:

*   Ich bin im Kino. Die Katze ist unter dem Tisch.

German has a range of "two-way prepositions":

*   in, auf, unter, über, an, neben, vor, hinter, zwischen

These will take the dative when describing a position. But when indicating a location change, they will instead take the accusative!

*   Ich gehe ins Kino. (I go to the cinema.)
*   Die Katze läuft unter den Tisch. (The cat runs under the table.)

This takes a lot of practice to master!

Some prepositions always go with dative:

*   von, zu, aus

And some always go with accusative:

*   durch, gegen, um

We recommend you learn the "pure" dative/accusative prepositions first. Then you only have to decide "location change or not?" for those that are not in that list.

### Liegen, legen

There are some verb pairs, where one verb describes a position, while the other indicates a placement:


|position|placement|
|--------|---------|
|liegen  |legen    |
|sitzen  |setzen   |
|stehen  |stellen  |
|hängen  |hängen   |


*   Das Buch liegt auf dem Tisch. (The book is on the table.)
*   Ich lege das Buch auf den Tisch. (I put the book on the table.)

The verbs in the first column will use the dative when used with prepositions such as "in, auf, …". Those in the second column will instead use the accusative. This was explained above.

The last two verbs in the table look the same, but they have different perfect participles:


|position |placement|
|---------|---------|
|gelegen  |gelegt   |
|gesessen |gesetzt  |
|gestanden|gestellt |
|gehangen |gehängt  |


Note that the variants for position have "strong" participles, while the ones for placement have "weak" (regular) ones.

### One more adjective ending

Remember that the adjective ending for "das, der, die, eine" ist _\-e_:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|fem.  |die    |alte     |Frau  |
|fem.  |eine   |alte     |Frau  |
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann  |
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind  |
|pl.   |—      |alte     |Männer|


In this skill, you will encounter the following new ending:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind|
|neut. |ein    |kleines  |Kind|


The logic here is that either the article or the adjective (but not both!) need to have an _\-s_ ending.

Nominative and accusative are the same for neuter, feminine and plural.

You will be able to practice all adjective endings in the later Clothes skill.

### Imperative

Compare the difference between a statement and an order in English:

*   You speak English.
*   Speak English!

Remember that German has three forms for "you":

*   "du" for a single person
*   "ihr" for multiple people
*   "Sie" for people (one or more), in polite mode

The imperative form for the latter two are straightforward:


|Statement                |Order                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|Ihr kommt in den Garten. |Kommt in den Garten!     |
|Sie kommen in den Garten.|Kommen Sie in den Garten!|


For _ihr_, you just remove the pronoun. For _Sie_, you place it after the verb, instead of before it.

For _du_, the main rule goes like this:


|Statement               |Order              |
|------------------------|-------------------|
|Du kommst in den Garten.|Komm in den Garten!|


You omit the pronoun, and the _\-st_ ending of the verb.

However, there are some quirks:

*   for irregular verbs, take the stem of the _du_\-form
*   but lose the umlaut, if present
*   for verb stems ending in _\-t/d_, the additional _\-e-_ remains


|Statement   |Order   |Explanation        |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
|Du trinkst. |Trink!  |Regular            |
|Du isst.    |Iss!    |Infinitive is essen|
|Du fährst.  |Fahr!   |Remove umlaut      |
|Du arbeitest|Arbeite!|extra e remains    |


#### Questions 2 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/questions-2/practice) ^

### Yes/No Questions

Questions can be asked by **switching the subject and verb**. For instance,

*   _Du verstehst_ das. (You understand this.)

becomes

*   _Verstehst du_ das? (Do you understand this?).

These kinds of questions will generally just elicit yes/no answers. In English, the main verb "to be" follows the same principle. "You are hungry." becomes "Are you hungry?".

In German, all verbs follow this principle. **There's no do-support**.

### Asking a Question in German With a W-Word

There are seven W-questions in German:


|English|German |
|-------|-------|
|what   |was    |
|who    |wer    |
|where  |wo     |
|when   |wann   |
|how    |wie    |
|why    |warum  |
|which  |welcher|


Don't mix up _wer_ and _wo_, which are "switched" in English :)

Some of these will change according to case.

#### _Was_ (what)

If you ask _was_ with a preposition, the two normally turn into a new word, according to the following pattern:


|English   |preposition|wo-    |
|----------|-----------|-------|
|for what  |für        |wofür  |
|about what|über       |worüber|
|with what |mit        |womit  |


If the preposition starts with a vowel, there will be an extra _\-r-_ to make it easier to pronounce.

This _wo-_ prefix does **not** mean "where".

#### _Wer_ (who)

_Wer_ is declinable and needs to **adjust to the cases**. The adjustment depends on what the question is targeting.

If you ask for the subject of a sentence (i.e. the nominative object), _wer_ (who) remains as is:

*   _Wer_ ist da? (Who is there?).

If you ask for the direct (accusative) object in a sentence, _wer_ changes to _wen_ (who/whom). As a mnemonic, notice how _wen_ rhymes with _den_ in _den Apfel_.

*   _Wen_ siehst du? — Ich sehe _den_ Hund.
*   (Whom do you see? — I see the dog.)

You will soon learn about the Dative case. You have to use _wem_ then. And there is a forth case in German (Genitive). You would use _wessen_ here. This corresponds to English "whose".

The endings look like the endings of _der_ (but don't change with gender/number):


|case      |masc.|Form of wer|
|----------|-----|-----------|
|nominative|der  |wer        |
|accusative|den  |wen        |
|dative    |dem  |wem        |


#### _Welche(r/s)_ (which)

_Welche-_ words are used to ask about for a specific item out of a group of items, such as "which car is yours?".

This declines not only for case, but also for gender. The endings are the same as for definite articles:


|article  |welch* |
|---------|-------|
|der      |welcher|
|das      |welches|
|die      |welche |
|die (pl.)|welche |
|den      |welchen|


#### _Wo_ (where)

In German, you can inquire about locations in several ways.

_Wo_ (where) is the general question word, but if you are **asking for a direction** in which someone or something is moving, you may **use \*wohin**\* (where to).

Consider these examples:

*   _Wo_ ist mein Schuh? (Where is my shoe?)
    
*   _Wohin_ gehst du? (Where are you going (to)?)
    

Furthermore, _wohin_ is separable into _wo_ + _hin_:

*   _Wo_ ist mein Schuh _hin_? (Where did my shoe go?)

The same goes for _woher_ (where from):

*   _Woher_ kommst du? (Where are you from)

might become

*   _Wo_ kommst du _her_?


|English   |German|
|----------|------|
|where     |wo    |
|where to  |wohin |
|where from|woher |


#### _Wann_ (when)

_Wann_ (when) does not change depending on the case. _Wann_ can be used with conjunctions such as _seit_ (since) or _bis_ (till):

*   _Seit wann_ wartest du? (Since when have you been waiting?)
    
*   _Bis wann_ geht der Film? (Till when does the movie last?).
    

Don't confuse _w**a**nn_ with _w**e**nn_ which you learned in Conjunctions. Both translate to "when" in English, but they have different functions in German.

*   _W**a**nn_ kommst du? (When are you coming?)
    
*   Ich schlafe nicht, _w**e**nn_ ich Musik höre. (I don't sleep when I listen to music)
    

#### _Warum_ (why)

_Warum_ (why) is also not declinable. It will never change endings. _Wieso_, _Weshalb_, and _Weswegen_ can be used instead of _Warum_. There's no difference in meaning.

Here is an example. All four following sentences mean "Why is the car so old?".

*   _Warum_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Wieso_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Weshalb_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Weswegen_ ist das Auto so alt?
    

#### _Wie viel_ vs. _wie viele_

_Wie viel_ is used with uncountable or countable nouns (how much/how many), and **_wie viele_ is only used with countable nouns** (how many). Some people think that "wie viel" can only be used with uncountable nouns, but that is not true.

*   _Wie viel_ Milch trinkst du? (How much milk do you drink?)
    
*   _Wie viel(e)_ Tiere siehst du? (How many animals do you see?)
    

#### Family 1 #7 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Family-1/practice) ^

#### Informal and formal words for family members

Just like in English, there are informal and formal words for "mother", "father", "grandmother", and "grandfather". Note that in German, the difference between formal and informal is a lot more pronounced than in English. The informal terms are pretty much only used within your own family.


|formal                          |informal             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
|die Mutter (the mother)         |die Mama (the mom)   |
|der Vater (the father)          |der Papa (the dad)   |
|die Großmutter (the grandmother)|die Oma (the grandma)|
|der Großvater (the grandfather) |der Opa (the grandpa)|


#### Family plurals

You might notice that most members of the close family have their own "system" of plurals:


|singular     |plural        |
|-------------|--------------|
|die Mutter   |die  Mütter   |
|der Vater    |die Väter     |
|der Bruder   |die Brüder    |
|die Tochter  |die Töchter   |
|die Schwester|die Schwestern|


_Schwester_ has an extra _\-n_, because it can't change its vowel (_e_ has no umlaut).

#### _Eltern_

_Eltern_ (parents) has no singular, unlike in English. We normally refer to _Mutter_ or _Vater_ then.

If necessary, there is a word _das Elternteil_ (literally, "the parents part"). But this is only used in formal settings, for example on forms.

#### Alternative words for family members

There are countless alternative words for certain family members. A lot of them are regionalisms or influenced by your own family's heritage. Some of them are ambiguous as well. For instance, some people call their father "papa", and some people call their grandfather "papa".

We can't accept all these terms, and since translations used in the German course for English speakers may also pop up in the English course for German speakers, we don't want to confuse German speakers with these words. Please understand that we're not going to add more alternatives. In your own interest, stick to the ones suggested by Duolingo (see above).

#### Food #3 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Food/practice) ^

#### The German Preposition _am_

Most likely, food is being consumed at the table. The German preposition _am_ is the contraction of _an_ (at/on) and _dem_ (the). For example, _The man eats at the table_ is _Der Mann isst am (an + dem) Tisch._ Since _an_ can translate to both _at_ and _on,_ _am_ can translate to both _at the_ and _on the,_ depending on the context. For example _an dem Tisch_ only translates to _at the table_ (context: spatial relationship between things) and _an dem Tag_ only translates to _on that day_ (context: temporal).

#### The verb _haben_ (to have)

In English, you can say "I'm having bread" when you really mean that you're eating or about to eat bread. **This does not work in German.** The verb **_haben_ refers to possession only.** Hence, the sentence _Ich habe Brot_ only translates to _I have bread_, not _I'm having bread._ Of course, the same applies to drinks. _Ich habe Wasser_ only translates to _I have water,_ not _I'm having water._

#### _Mittagessen_ - lunch or dinner?

We're aware that _dinner_ is sometimes used synonymously with _lunch,_ but for the purpose of this course, we're defining _Frühstück_ as _breakfast,_ _Mittagessen_ as _lunch,_ and _dinner_ / _supper_ as _Abendessen_ / _Abendbrot._

#### Compound words

A compound word is a word that consists of two or more words. These are written as one word (no spaces).

The gender of a compound noun is always determined by its last element. This shouldn't be too difficult to remember because the last element is always the most important one. All the previous elements merely describe the last element.

*   **die** Auto**bahn** (das Auto + die Bahn)
    
*   **der** Orangen**saft** (die Orange + der Saft)
    
*   **das** Hunde**futter** (der Hund + das Futter)
    

Sometimes, there's a connecting sound (_Fugenlaut_) between two elements. For instance, _die Orange_ + _der Saft_ becomes _der Orange**n**saft,_ _der Hund_ + _das Futter_ becomes _das Hund**e**futter_, _die Liebe_ + _das Lied_ becomes _das Liebe**s**lied_, and _der Tag_ + _das Gericht_ becomes _das Tag**es**gericht_.

#### Cute like sugar!

The word _süß_ means _sweet_ when referring to food, and _cute_ when referring to living beings.

*   Der Zucker ist süß. (The sugar is sweet.)
*   Die Katze ist süß. (The cat is cute.)

#### Accusative Prepositions #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Accusative-Prepositions/practice) ^

### Prepositions

Prepositions take a noun (or a noun phrase):

*   I talk _with a friend from school_.

In German, prepositions will change this noun into one of the cases (but never into nominative).

Here, you learn those that always trigger the accusative case.

Remember that as long as the noun is not masculine singular, the nominative and the accusative will look the same.

*   _Der_ Hund trinkt _den_ Saft. (both are masculine)
*   _Die_ Katze trinkt _die_ Milch. (both are feminine)

#### Accusative prepositions

Accusative prepositions _always_ trigger the accusative case.

*   Nicht **ohne meinen Hund**! (Not without my dog!)
*   Die Suppe ist **für den Mann ohne Zähne**. (The soup is for the man without teeth.)

German has these common accusative prepositions: **durch, für, gegen, ohne, um**

#### _Entlang_

_Entlang_ is a strange word :) It is commonly used with the accusative case. But then it has to appear **after the noun**.

*   Ich gehe _den Fluss entlang_. (I walk along the river.)

It can be used before the noun, but then triggers a different case. This sounds a bit old-fashioned or stilted today. So better use it after the noun.

#### Weather 1 #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Weather-1/practice) ^

### _Werden_

The German auxiliary verb _werden_ has several functions, depending on grammatical context.

When used with an adjective or noun, it corresponds to English "to get/become":

*   Ich werde müde! (I am getting tired!)
*   Er wird Vater. (He is becoming a father.)

The forms of _werden_ roughly follow the pattern of strong verbs (essen, fahren, …):

*   the second and third person singular change the vowel
*   but the third person singular has an irregular ending


|       |      |
|-------|------|
|ich    |werde |
|du     |wirst |
|er     |wird  |
|wir    |werden|
|ihr    |werdet|
|sie/Sie|werden|


#### Numbers 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Numbers-1/practice) ^

### German numbers

You might notice that German numbers look very similar to those in English. The two languages are closely related. So any time you encounter a new word, it's worth checking whether you can find a similar-looking word in English.

At some point, you might realize that there are several more or less consistent changes between English and German. Here are some:


|Change  |English |German    |
|--------|--------|----------|
|t > s/z |ten, two|zehn, zwei|
|gh > ch |eight   |acht      |
|v > b   |seven   |sieben    |
|th > d/t|three   |drei      |
|o > ei  |one, two|eins, zwei|


Generally, the vowels change faster than the consonants. So go for the consonants when looking for related words.

### _Zahlen, zahlen, zählen_

You learned _bezahlen_ (to pay) earlier. There's also the word _zahlen_, which also means to pay. In this lesson, you learn _z**ä**hlen_, which means "to count". Don't confuse the two.

In addition, you will see _Zahlen_. The upper-case initial tells you this is a noun. It is the plural of _die Zahl_ (the number).

#### Office #3 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Office/practice) ^

### Some irregular perfect participles

In this skill, you will encounter the following irregular perfect participles:


|Infinitive|Perfect participle|
|----------|------------------|
|werden    |geworden          |
|sein      |gewesen           |


#### Clothes #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Clothes/practice) ^

### Review adjective endings

In this skill, you will encounter all adjective endings for the three main cases: nominative, accusative and dative.

As described in earlier skills, the adjective ending for "das, der, die, eine" ist _\-e_:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|fem.  |die    |alte     |Frau  |
|fem.  |eine   |alte     |Frau  |
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann  |
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind  |
|pl.   |—      |alte     |Männer|


You also learned that for neuter, either the article or the adjective (but not both!) need to have an _\-s_ ending:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind|
|neut. |ein    |kleines  |Kind|


The same logic applies to masculine forms. Either the article or the adjective end in _\-r_:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann|
|masc. |ein    |alter    |Mann|


Nominative and accusative are the same for neuter, feminine and plural.

For masculine accusative, the articles and the adjective both get _\-en_ endings:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|masc. |den    |alten    |Mann|
|masc. |einen  |alten    |Mann|


Finally, dative adjectives end in _\-en_, regardless of person.

#### Dative Case #5 · 2019-01-11[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Dative-Case/practice) ^

### The Dative Case

Welcome to the third important case in German :) Later on, there will be a last, less important one.

#### Remember the Accusative ?

You already saw that the **accusative case** can be used in different ways.

It can signify the _object of a sentence_:

*   Der Hund frisst _den Vogel_. (The dog is eating the bird.)

This is called the **direct object** (or **accusative object**).

It can also be used _in combination with some prepositions_:

*   Sie geht _ohne den Hund_. (She walks without the dog.)
*   Er hat einen Mantel _ohne Knöpfe_. (He has a coat without buttons.)

#### Dative object

The **dative case** also **has a range of different functions**.

In this lesson, you learn to use it with the **indirect object**. This is also called the **dative object**.

The indirect object in a sentence is the **receiver of the direct (accusative) object**.

For example, _Frau_ is the indirect (dative) object in

*   Das Mädchen gibt _einer Frau_ den Apfel. (A girl gives the apple _to a woman_.)

You can think about it as "the other person involved" in a transaction.

*   Ich gebe _dem Mann_ einen Apfel. (I give _the man_ an apple.)
*   Sie zeigt _dem Kind_ den Hund. (She shows _the child_ the dog.)

As a rule the **dative object comes before the accusative object**, if none of these objects is a pronoun (things are a little more complicated if pronouns come into play):

#### Dative verbs

The dative is also used for certain dative verbs such as _danken_ (to thank) and _antworten_ (to answer), or _helfen_ (to help):

*   Ich danke _dem Kind_. (I thank the child.)
*   Ich helfe _der Frau_. (I help the woman.)
*   Ich antworte _meinem Bruder_. (I answer my brother.)

These verbs don't have an accusative object.

#### Dative articles

Note that the **dative changes all articles for the words**.

For example, _die Katze_ is a feminine noun. However, the article in dative will be _der_. This might look like the masculine article. But in the context of a sentence, there will never be any confusion between the two, as long as you know your genders. This is one reason why it's so important to know the gender of a word.


|definite articles|Nominative|Accusative|Dative|
|-----------------|----------|----------|------|
|masculine        |der       |den       |dem   |
|neuter           |das       |das       |dem   |
|feminine         |die       |die       |der   |
|plural           |die       |die       |den   |



|indefinite articles|Nominative|Accusative|Dative  |
|-------------------|----------|----------|--------|
|masculine          |ein       |einen     |einem   |
|neuter             |ein       |ein       |einem   |
|feminine           |eine      |eine      |einer   |
|plural             |(keine)   |(keine)   |(keinen)|


Notice how **masculine and neuter look the same in Dative** (just like they look the same for Nominative indefinite articles).

This also means that if you see a noun in the Dative, and the article ends in _\-r_, it will be a feminine word. Alternatively, if it ends in _\-m_, it won't.

It is very much **worth remembering these Dative endings**, because they will pop up in different context, and help you a lot to sort out the grammar. In a way, Dative is the "simplest" case :)


|                |Dative endings|
|----------------|--------------|
|Masculine/Neuter|-m            |
|Feminine        |-r            |
|Plural          |-n            |


#### Plural Nouns in Dative

Here's a great rule:

**Plural Dative: Everything gets an _\-n_**

(Insert Oprah Winfrey GIF here)

You just saw that articles (also pronouns etc.) get an _\-n_ ending in dative plural.

Later, you will learn that the German ending system for adjectives is a bit complicated. However, in dative plural, you just **add an _\-n_**.

It goes so far that even **plural forms of nouns get an extra _\-n_ in the Dative**.

*   Er hat _drei Hunde_. Er spielt _mit drei Hunden_. (He plays with three dogs.)
*   Die Computer sind alt. Ich antworte _den Computern_. (I answer the computers.)

There are two "exceptions":

*   If the plural already end in _\-n_, you're set.
*   If the plural ends in _\-s_, there's also no change.

#### Even more _\-n_

**Some masculine nouns add an _\-en_ or _\-n_ ending** in the dative and in **all other cases besides the nominative**. For example in the dative, it is _dem Jungen_ (the boy).

If you want to look these up, the term for them is "n-Declension".

#### Dative Pronouns #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Dative-Pronouns/practice) ^

#### Personal Pronouns in the Dative Case

Many words change in the dative case. For the third person pronouns, the following are different from the nominative case: the masculine pronoun is _ihm_ (to him), the feminine is _ihr_ (to her), the neuter is _ihm_ (to it), and the plural is _ihnen_ (to them).


|Nominative   |Accusative    |Dative         |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
|ich (I)      |mich (me)     |mir (to me)    |
|du           |dich          |dir            |
|er / es / sie|ihn / es / sie|ihm / ihm / ihr|
|wir          |uns           |uns            |
|ihr          |euch          |euch           |
|sie          |sie           |ihnen          |


Some observations:

*   In dative, _mir, dir, ihr_ (to me / you / her) rhyme.
    
*   In the **third person**, the **endings are the same as for the articles**: _\-m, -r, -n_. However, plural dative is "ihn**en**" (not _ihn_, as you might expect).
    
*   In the second person plural, accusative and dative pronouns are the same.
    

Now you can understand why, when thanking a female person, it is only correct to say _Ich danke ihr_ ("I thank her", literally "I give-thank to her") and not _Ich danke sie_ (that sounds like "I thank she" would sound to an English speaker).

#### Dative verbs

Remember that some verbs have a dative object. This is just a quirk of German. There was a reason for it when these words were created, but it's not easy to understand anymore, after a lot of language change.

In short, you just have to learn these :) There aren't very many.

_Gehören_ literally means to "belong to". But don't translate too literally, often a different translation will be more natural.

*   Wem gehört das Kleid? ("Whose dress is it?" - Literally, "Whom does the dress belong to?")

#### Family 2 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Family-2/practice) ^

#### Tall and short people

Tall people are _groß_, not _hoch_, and short people are _klein_, not _kurz_.

This is why German people will often refer to tall people as "big" :)

#### _Cousin, Cousine_

These are French words. While it is possible to write _Cousine_ as _Kusine_ now, German never found a way to actually spell _Cousin_ differently. This is because German originally does not have the French sound at the end. Some people pronounce it like "Kusäng" instead.

#### _Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel_ - Why not _ihren Onkel?_

Both _Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel_ and _Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel_ are grammatically correct, but they don't have the same meaning.

When you say _Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel_, you're either talking about the woman's own uncle, another female person's uncle, or the uncle of multiple people.

When you say _Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel_, you're talking about another person's uncle, and that person is male. People can know other people's relatives.

#### Dative Prepositions #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Dative-Prepositions/practice) ^

### Dative prepositions

Earlier, you learned that some prepositions always trigger the accusative case.

The most common ones are **durch, für, gegen, ohne, um**.

In the same way, dative prepositions **always** trigger the dative case.

Again, here are the common ones: **aus, bei, gegenüber, mit, nach, seit, von, zu**.

### Contractions

Some prepositions and articles can be contracted.


|preposition + article|contraction|
|---------------------|-----------|
|bei + dem            |beim       |
|von + dem            |vom        |
|vor + das            |vors       |
|zu + dem             |zum        |
|zu + der             |zur        |


There are some more, which you will learn later.

### _Seit_

_Seit_ roughly means "since". However, it works a bit differently.

First, it always denotes something that is **still going on**.

Second, it has **three different ways** of usage.

Consider these examples:

*   Ich lerne _seit sechs Jahren_ Englisch. (I'm learning English for six years now.)
*   Ich lerne _seit 2012_ Englisch (I've been learning English since 2012.)
*   Ich lerne Englisch, _seit ich denken kann_. (I've been learning English since I can think.)

In the first example, _seit_ defines a stretch of time, which reaches into the present.

In the second example, it also defines a stretch of time, reaching into the present. But it defines this stretch of time by its starting point.

_Seit_ can also be a subordinating conjunction (check the lesson "Conjunctions"). In these, the verb leaves the second position of the sentence, and ends up at the end. This is why in the last example, _ich kann denken_ (I can think) turns into _seit ich denken **kann**_.

### _Zu Hause_ vs. _nach Hause_

_Zu Hause_ means _at home_, and _nach Hause_ means _home_ (_homewards_, not _at home_).

The _\-e_ at the end of _zu Hause_ and _nach Hause_ is an archaic dative ending, which is no longer used in modern German, but survived in certain fixed expressions.

*   Ich bin zu Hause. (I am at home.)
    
*   Ich gehe nach Hause. (I am walking home.)
    

#### Zoo #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Zoo/practice) ^

### More animal gender

Again, the gender of a word for an animal does not depend on the animal's actual gender, but on the word.

*   der: Bär, Papagei, Tiger, Elefant, Pinguin, Löwe, Affe
*   die: Giraffe
*   das: Kamel, Zebra

Note that "Löwe, Affe" are masculine. The "die -e" rule is very robust, but only if applied to words describing objects:

*   die Lampe, die Tasche, die Jacke, die Schule, …

### _X-mal_

The German word _mal_ translates to _times_ quite often:

*   drei _mal_ drei (three _times_ three)
*   manch_mal_ (some_times_)
*   fünf_mal_ (five _times_)

### _Einer ist keiner_

Earlier, you learned the various forms of "a(n)" in German:


|gender     |Nominative|Accusative|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|der (masc.)|ein       |einen     |
|das (neut.)|ein       |ein       |
|die (fem.) |eine      |eine      |


These can mean "a(n)" as well as "one":

*   Ich habe einen Hund. (I have a/one dog.)

In the earlier skill "Need" you saw that "my, your, …" have the same endings:

*   Das ist ein_e_ Katze. Das ist mein_e_ Katze.
*   Er hat ein_en_ Hund. Er hat mein_en_ Hund!

You also learned in "Need" that "mine, yours, …", "which" and "this/that" have the same endings as "the" in German:

*   Dies_er_ Hund is mein_er_. (This dog is mine.)
*   Welch_es_ Haus ist dein_es_? (Which house is yours?)

In English, you can also say:

*   I have two dogs. Here is _one_.

Here, it acts more like a pronoun, similar to "mine, yours, …".

And just like for "mine, yours, …", the endings will then be the same as for "the":


|gender     |Nominative|Accusative|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|der (masc.)|einer     |einen     |
|das (neut.)|eines     |eines     |
|die (fem.) |eine      |eine      |


Note that all non-bold forms look identical to the forms of "a(n)" that you learned earlier.

Look at these three sentences, all meaning "Here is one!" in English:


|gender|sentence       |topic   |
|------|---------------|--------|
|masc. |Hier ist einer!|der Hund|
|neut. |Hier ist eines!|das Kind|
|fem.  |Hier ist eine! |die Frau|


_Keiner_ (none, no-one) works the same way:

*   Hier ist kein_er_! (There is no-one here!)
*   Ich brauche Wasser, aber hier ist kein_es_! (I need water, but there is none here!)

### _Meist-_

_Meist-_ works similar to English "most", but there are differences.

*   der meiste Wein (most wine)
*   die meisten Leute (most people)
*   mit den meisten Leuten (with most people)
    
*   German uses the definite article
    
*   The endings change like those of adjectives

### _Täglich_ etc.

Instead of "every month", German uses "monthly" for all time intervals:


|Noun       |Adjective  |
|-----------|-----------|
|die Sekunde|sekündlich |
|die Minute |minütlich  |
|die Stunde |stündlich  |
|der Tag    |täglich    |
|die Woche  |wöchentlich|
|der Monat  |monatlich  |
|das Jahr   |jährlich   |


Mind that all of these have an umlaut change, except for _monatlich_.

### Another dative verb

_Folgen_ (to follow) has a dative object only:

*   Ich folge dem Hund. (I follow the dog.)

Earlier, you learned some other verbs that only take a dative object:

*   helfen: Ich helfe einem Kind. (I thank a child.)
*   danken: Ich danke meiner Mutter. (I thank my mother.)
*   antworten: Antworte mir! (Answer me!)
*   glauben: Sie glaubt ihm nicht. (Sie does not believe him.)

There are not very many of these "dative only" verbs in German.

### Animal gender

*   die Taube, die Ente, die Fliege, die Wespe, die Biene, die Mücke
*   das Eichhörnchen
*   der Schwan, der Spatz, der Schmetterling

### _Beißen, stechen_

_Beißen_ (to bite) and _stechen_ (to sting) are strong (slightly irregular) verbs:


|Person     |beißen  |stechen  |
|-----------|--------|---------|
|ich        |beiße   |steche   |
|du         |beißt   |stichst  |
|er/sie/es  |beißt   |sticht   |
|wir        |beißen  |stechen  |
|ihr        |beißt   |stecht   |
|sie/Sie    |beißen  |stechen  |
|perf. part.|gebissen|gestochen|


#### Forest #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Forest/practice) ^

### Animal gender

*   der Wolf, Fuchs, Käfer, Grashüpfer
*   die Eule, Motte, Zecke, Ameise

### _Sollen_

_Sollen_ is a modal verb. Unlike most others, it does not change its vowel.

Here are its present tense forms:


|Person   |sollen|
|---------|------|
|ich      |soll  |
|du       |sollst|
|er/sie/es|soll  |
|wir      |sollen|
|ihr      |sollt |
|sie/Sie  |sollen|


#### Sick #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Sick/practice) ^

### _Links, rechts_

When used as an adjective, the German forms for "left/right" are normal:

*   Mein linker Arm (my left arm)

When used as an adverb, they get an extra _\-s_:

*   Ich gehe nach link_s_. (I go to the left.)
*   Der Tisch ist recht_s_. (The table is to the right.)

### Body parts

*   der Kopf, Arm, Hals, Finger, Rücken, Muskel, Bauch, Fuß, Daumen, Zeh
*   das Ohr, Blut, Auge, Herz, Bein, Knie
*   die Hand, Schulter, Nase

### Pain

There are two main ways to express pain in German.

First, you can just combine the body part with "Schmerzen" (a plural word meaning "pain"):

*   Ich habe starke Kopfschmerzen! (I have a strong headache!)

This works for only some kinds of body parts, though.

Another way is to say "Mein X tut weh." (Literally, "my X does pain.)

*   Mein Kopf _tut_ weh. (My head hurts)
*   Meine Füße _tun_ weh. (My feet hurt.)

### _Wegen, gegen_

_Gegen_ (against) always takes accusative:

*   Er läuft _gegen die Wand_. (He runs against the wall.)

_Wegen_ usually takes the dative:

*   _Wegen meiner Mutter_ sind wir hier. (Because of my mother, we are here.)

It can also take the genitive (the fourth, less important case). You will learn about this soon.

#### Party #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Party/practice) ^

### And another adjective ending!

As described in earlier skills, the adjective ending for "das, der, die, eine" ist _\-e_:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|fem.  |die    |alte     |Frau  |
|fem.  |eine   |alte     |Frau  |
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann  |
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind  |
|pl.   |—      |alte     |Männer|


In the last skill, you learned that for neuter, either the article or the adjective (but not both!) need to have an _\-s_ ending:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|neut. |das    |kleine   |Kind|
|neut. |ein    |kleines  |Kind|


The same logic applies to masculine forms. Either the article or the adjective end in _\-r_:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|masc. |der    |alte     |Mann|
|masc. |ein    |alter    |Mann|


Nominative and accusative are the same for neuter, feminine and plural.

Keep in mind that for masculine accusative, the articles and the adjective both get _\-en_ endings:


|gender|article|adjective|noun|
|------|-------|---------|----|
|masc. |den    |alten    |Mann|
|masc. |einen  |alten    |Mann|


Now you can use all nominative and accusative forms, and also (in general) all dative forms (which so far all end in _\-en_)!

### Ordinal numbers

Ordinals are adjectives, and carry the same endings:

*   Ich wohne im fünften Stock. (I live on the fifth floor.)
*   Der fünfte Juni ist ein Montag. (June 5th is a Monday.)

The general rule is that from one to nineteen, you add a _\-t-_ between number and adjective ending:


|   |          |
|---|----------|
|2. |zweite    |
|4. |vierte    |
|8. |achte     |
|10.|zehnte    |
|12.|zwölfte   |
|19.|neunzehnte|


Starting with twenty, you add _\-st-_ instead:


|     |                 |
|-----|-----------------|
|20.  |zwanzigste       |
|42.  |zweiundvierzigste|
|100. |hundertste       |
|1000.|tausendste       |


Only three forms are irregular:


|   |      |
|---|------|
|1. |erste |
|3. |dritte|
|7. |siebte|


Note that in German, you just place a dot after a number to indicate it is an ordinal.

### Overview pronouns

By now, you have encountered all the pronouns for all the three main cases:


|Nom.   |Acc.   |Dat.   |
|-------|-------|-------|
|ich    |mich   |mir    |
|du     |dich   |dir    |
|er     |ihn    |ihm    |
|es     |es     |ihm    |
|sie    |sie    |ihr    |
|wir    |uns    |uns    |
|ihr    |euch   |euch   |
|sie/Sie|sie/Sie|ihr/Ihr|


The next table shows the possessive pronouns. Only two endings are given here:

*   no ending (neuter nominative/accusative + masculine nominative)
*   _\-e_ ending (feminine + plural, for both nominative and accusative)


|Person |Nom. masc./neut.|Nom./Akk. fem./pl.|
|-------|----------------|------------------|
|ich    |mein            |meine             |
|du     |dein            |deine             |
|er/es  |sein            |seine             |
|sie    |ihr             |ihre              |
|wir    |unser           |unsere            |
|ihr    |euer            |eure              |
|sie/Sie|ihr/Ihr         |ihre/Ihre         |


Note that for _euer_, the last _\-e-_ of the word stem gets lost when adding an ending.

The complete endings set is the same as for _ein_:


|Case + gender  |example poss. pronoun|
|---------------|---------------------|
|Nom. m/n, Acc n|mein                 |
|Acc m          |meinen               |
|Nom/Acc f/pl   |meine                |
|Dat m/n        |meinem               |
|Dat f          |meiner               |
|Dat pl         |meinen               |


### Some irregular perfect participles

In this skill, you will encounter the following irregular perfect participles:


|Infinitive|Perfect participle|
|----------|------------------|
|schlafen  |geschlafen        |
|essen     |gegessen          |
|singen    |gesungen          |
|trinken   |getrunken         |
|finden    |gefunden          |
|helfen    |geholfen          |
|gehen     |gegangen          |
|verstehen |verstanden        |


In addition, there is a small group of "mixed" verbs, that change the verb stem, but keep the _\-t_ ending:


|Infinitive|Perfect participle|
|----------|------------------|
|rennen    |gerannt           |
|brennen   |gebrannt          |
|müssen    |gemusst           |


#### Verbs Imperative #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Imperative/practice) ^

### Imperative

The imperative mood is used to express commands, just like in English.

There are three different forms, according to the three types of "you" in German.

#### _Du_ imperative

The imperative for _du_ is very similar to English:

*   _Du gehst_ nach Hause. (You go home.)
*   _Geh_ nach Hause! (Go home!)

For most verbs, to come up with the correct verb form, just lose the _\-st_ ending:

*   Du arbeite**st** nachts. (You work at night)
*   Arbeite nachts! (Work at night!)
    
*   Du nimm**st** das Taxi. (You take the taxi.)
    
*   Nimm das Taxi! (Take the taxi!)

You might have noticed that some common verbs have an extra umlaut in the 2nd/3rd person singular:

*   f**a**hren, du f**ä**hrst
*   schl**a**fen, du schl**ä**fst

In the imperative, **these do not have an umlaut**:

*   Du f**ä**hrst mit dem Taxi.
*   F**a**hr mit dem Taxi!

#### _Ihr_ imperative

The second one is used to address more than one person informally. It uses the same conjugation as the regular _ihr_ form of the present tense. This form of the imperative does not include a personal pronoun.

*   _Ihr fahrt_ nach Paris. (You go to Paris.)
*   _Fahrt_ nach Paris! (Go to Paris!)

#### _Sie_ imperative

The third one is used to address one or more people formally. It uses the same conjugation as the regular _Sie_ form of the present tense. The formal imperative is the only form to include the personal pronoun (_Sie_). Note that the word order is reversed. The verb always precedes the pronoun. It essentially looks like a question.

*   _Sie lernen_ Deutsch. (You learn German.)
*   _Lernen Sie_ Deutsch! (Learn German!)
*   Lernen Sie Deutsch**?** (Do you learn German?)

#### Imperative for _sein_

The verb _sein_ (to be) is highly irregular. It even has its own imperative version:


|normal  |imperative|
|--------|----------|
|du bist |sei       |
|ihr seid|seid      |
|Sie sind|seien Sie |


The following sentences all mean "Please be quiet!":

*   _Sei_ bitte ruhig! (one friend)
*   _Seid_ bitte ruhig! (several friends)
*   _Seien Sie_ bitte ruhig! (some person in the cinema)

### _Nehmen, du nimmst_??

As mentioned before, a small number of common verbs changes the vowel in the second + third person singular.

The change will normally be from _a_ to _ä_ or from _e_ to _i(e)_.


|         |nehmen|geben|essen|lesen|lassen|
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
|ich      |nehme |gebe |esse |lese |lasse |
|du       |nimmst|gibst|isst |liest|lässt |
|er/sie/es|nimmt |gibt |isst |liest|lässt |
|wir      |nehmen|geben|essen|lesen|lassen|
|ihr      |nehmt |gebt |esst |lest |lasst |
|sie/Sie  |nehmen|geben|essen|lesen|lassen|


#### Form #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Form/practice) ^

### Form

In this skill, you learn the basics necessary to fill in a form.

_Ledig_ means you have never been married.

### _Heiraten_ vs. _verheiratet_

In earlier times, parents would decide who to marry. They would literally "marry off" their children. This is what "verheiraten" refers to. We don't do that anymore, but we still use its perfect participle as an adjective/adverb:

*   Ich bin verheiratet. (I am married.)
*   der verheiratete Mann (the married man)

On the other hand, "heiraten" means "to marry":

*   Ich möchte ihn heiraten. (I want to marry him.)
*   Ich habe geheiratet. (I have married.)

These often get confused, because English uses the same word for both.

#### Occupation 1 #4 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Occupation-1/practice) ^

### _Student_ or _Schüler?_

**_Ein Student_ is a university student** and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### Dropping articles

When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as _I'm a teacher_ or _She's a judge_, German speakers **usually drop the indefinite article** _(ein/eine)_.

*   Ich bin Lehrer. (I am **a** teacher.)

It sounds more natural to say _Ich bin Lehrer_ and _Sie ist Richterin_ than _Ich bin ein Lehrer_ and _Sie ist eine Richterin_. This rule also applies to students.

If you **add an adjective**, you **can't drop the article**. _Er ist ein schlechter Arzt_ (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but _Er ist schlechter Arzt_ is not.

Also note that **you can't drop the definite article** _(der/die/das)_.

#### Male and female variants

The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to.

So the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically feminine.

In the vast majority of cases, **the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix _\-in_ to the male variant**, e.g. _der Bäcker_ becomes _die Bäckerin_ and _der Schüler_ (the pupil) becomes _die Schülerin_.

**The plural** of the female variant **is formed by adding the ending _\-innen_** to the singular of the male variant, e.g. _die Bäcker**innen**_ and _die Schüler**innen**_.

Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female variant as well.


|      |singular  |plural       |
|------|----------|-------------|
|male  |der Koch  |die Köche    |
|female|die Köchin|die Köchinnen|


You learn one more word like this in this lesson:

*   der **A**rzt, die **Ä**rztin (the doctor)

#### _Sie ist der Boss!_

There are a few words for people where the grammatical and the natural gender differ. One of them is _der Boss_. There is no feminine version for it, although there are certainly female bosses.

*   **Mein** Boss heißt Linda Ackermann.
*   **Meine** Chef**in** heißt Linda Ackermann.

#### Living #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Living/practice) ^

### _Mieter, Vermieter_

The prefix _ver-_ often means "away":

*   kaufen, verkaufen (buy, sell)
*   verlieren (to lose), vergessen (to forget)

_Mieten_ means "to rent" (you pay), while _vermieten_ indicates you rent out (you get the rent).

### High, higher

_Hoch_ is one of the few irregular adjectives in German:

*   Das Haus ist _hoch_.
*   Mein Haus ist _höher_.
*   Sein Haus ist _am höchsten_.

Also, _hoch_ will change when it gets an ending:

*   Diese Stadt hat _hohe_ Häuser.

#### Prepositions #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Prepositions/practice) ^

### Prepositions

#### Accusative prepositions

Accusative prepositions **always** trigger the accusative case.

Here are the most common ones: **durch, für, gegen, ohne, um**

#### Dative prepositions

Dative prepositions **always** trigger the dative case.

Here are the most common ones: **aus, außer, bei, gegenüber, mit, nach, seit, von, zu**

#### Two-way prepositions

**Two-way prepositions** take the **dative case or the accusative case**, depending on the context.

This is an unusual, but central part of German grammar.

If there's **movement from one place to another**, use the **accusative** case.

*   Die Katze geht _in die Küche_. (The cat walks into the kitchen.)

If there's **no movement**, or if there's **movement within a certain place**, use the **dative** case.

*   Die Katze schläft _in der Küche_. (The cat sleeps in the kitchen.)
*   Die Katze geht _in der Küche_. (The cat walks within the kitchen.)

These prepositions can switch case: **an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen**

#### When _not_ to think about location change

Two-way prepositions are very common in everyday speech, so it's a good idea to practice them to fluency.

However, don't forget that **for some prepositions, you don't have to decide**:

_Durch_ and _um_ will always be accusative, although they might signify an activity without location change:

*   Das Kind rennt _durch den_ Wald. (The child is running through the forest.)
*   Die Stühle stehen _um den_ Tisch. (The chairs are standing around the table.)

_Aus_, _von_, _zu_ will always be dative, although they might signify a location change.

*   Er kommt _aus der_ Küche (He comes out of the kitchen.)
*   Ich fahre _zur_ Arbeit. (I go to work.)
*   Ich komme _von der_ Arbeit. (I come from work.)

#### Other uses for two-way prepositions

Some verbs use one of these prepositions in a way that is _not about location_. This is part of language change, where things get repurposed all the time.

_Über_ will always trigger the accusative case:

*   Sie diskutieren _über den_ Krieg. (They discuss the war.)

When used with these verbs, _vor_ will always trigger the Dative:

*   Er warnt _vor dem_ Hund. (He warns about the dog.)

_An_, _in_ and _auf_ are more complicated: in some verbs, they trigger the accusative, in others the dative. You'll just have to memorize these.

*   Er _denkt_ _an seinen_ Bruder. (He thinks of his brother.)
*   Er _arbeitet_ _an einem_ Film (He's working on a film.)
    
*   Ich _warte_ _auf den_ Bus. (I'm waiting for the bus.)
    
*   Der Film _basiert_ _auf meinem_ Leben. (The film is based on my life.)

#### Contractions

Some prepositions and articles can be contracted.


|an + das    |ans    |
|------------|-------|
|an + dem    |am     |
|auf + das   |aufs   |
|bei + dem   |beim   |
|in + das    |ins    |
|in + dem    |im     |
|hinter + das|hinters|
|über + das  |übers  |
|um + das    |ums    |
|unter + das |unters |
|von + dem   |vom    |
|vor + das   |vors   |
|zu + dem    |zum    |
|zu + der    |zur    |


*   Wir gehen _ins_ Kino (We go to the cinema.)

If you would use "that" in English, you would not use a contraction:

*   In _das_ Kino gehe ich nicht! (I won't go into _that_ cinema!)

#### Preposition at the end of a sentence??

An important part of German grammar is that some verbs can split off their prefix. This often ends up at the end of a sentence. Some of these prefixes look exactly like a preposition.

So when you see a "preposition" at the end of a sentence, try to combine it with the verb. You might just have learned a new word :)

*   Sie _macht_ die Lampe _an_. (_anmachen_ means "turn on" here)
    
*   Ich _denke nach_. (_nachdenken_ means "to think")
    
*   _Pass_ auf dich _auf_! (_aufpassen_ means "to take care")
    
*   Wann _fährt_ der Zug _ab_? (_abfahren_ means "to depart")
    
*   _Nimm_ deinen Hut _ab_! (_abnehmen_ means "to take off" in this context)
    

Unfortunately, the way Duolingo is built does not allow to selectively teach German sentence structure. We hope this will change soon :)

### _Zu Hause_ vs. _nach Hause_

_Zu Hause_ means _at home_, and _nach Hause_ means _home_ (_homewards_, not _at home_). The _\-e_ at the end of _zu Hause_ and _nach Hause_ is an archaic dative ending, which is no longer used in modern German, but survives in certain fixed expressions.

*   Ich bin _zu Hause_. (I am _at home_.)
    
*   Ich gehe _nach Hause_. (I am walking _home_.)
    

#### Job #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Job/practice) ^

### _Auf Wiederhören_

_Auf Wiedersehen_ is a rather formal way of saying "goodbye":

*   Auf Wiedersehen, Frau Müller!

However, it literally means "see you again", so it cannot be used over the phone. Instead, German uses _auf Wiederhören_ (hear you again):

*   Auf Wiederhören, Herr Müller!

### Information

Unlike in English, _Information_ can be singular or plural:

*   Die _Information_ war richtig.
*   Die _Informationen_ sind interessant.

#### Journey #5 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Journey/practice) ^

### _Gleis, Bahnsteig_

Both _das Gleis_ and _der Bahnsteig_ are used for English "station platform". _Gleis_ can also be the rail tracks themselves.

### Visa

English uses "visa" (from a Latin adjective) for the singular. German uses the singular _Visum_ for one visa, and the plural _Visa_ (or alternatively _Visen_) for several visas. Due to globalization, this is currently in flux, with many Germans using the English "ein Visa, zwei Visas".

#### Comparisons #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Comparisons/practice) ^

#### German is simpler than English! (sometimes)

In English, there are two systems for making comparisons:

*   She is _older_ than him.
*   Icelandic is _more complicated_ than German.

German only uses the first system:

*   Sie ist _älter_ als er.
*   Isländisch ist _komplizierter_ als Deutsch.

This is pretty straightforward. However, quite often, the vowel of short adjectives will **get an umlaut change**:


|normal     |comparative|superlative|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|alt (old)  |älter      |am ältesten|
|groß  (big)|größer     |am größten |
|oft (often)|öfter      |am öftesten|


You might notice that there will be an extra _e_ in the superlative, if the word stem ends in _t_ (or _d_). This is a general sound rule, just like in _ich arbei**t**e, er arbeit**e**t_.

In addition, in some adjectives an _e_ gets lost:

*   teuer, **teurer** (not teu**e**rer), am teuersten

Again, this is a general sound rule. You might have noticed it for _euer_ (plural _your_), which becomes _eure_, not _eu**e**re_ when it gets an ending.

There is a small number of irregular forms:


|normal        |comparative|superlative|

|gut (good)    |besser     |am besten  |

#### Comparative adjectives are just adjectives

Consider these examples:

*   Sie hat eine schön**e** Uhr.
*   Sie hat eine schöner**e** Uhr (als ich).

As you can see, comparative adjectives get adjective endings, just like any "normal" adjective.

This can sometimes look a bit confusing:

*   Er ist mein jung**er** Bruder. (He's my little brother.)
*   Er ist mein jüng**erer** Bruder. (He's my younger brother.)

In the second example, the first _\-er_ is for the comparative, the second _\-er_ is the ending from _d**er** Bruder_.

If you find that really confusing, why not practice adjective endings a bit? :) You can do so in the earlier lesson "Colors".

### _Lang_ vs. _lange_

Just as _gern(e)_ and _allein(e)_, when used as an adverb, _lange_ can omit the _\-e_, without any change in meaning:

*   Ich schlafe morgen _lang(e)_. (I sleep long tomorrow.)

### _Wissen_ vs. _kennen_

_Wissen_ is not a modal verb, but its forms resemble one:


|Person   |wissen|
|---------|------|
|ich      |weiß  |
|du       |weißt |
|er/sie/es|weiß  |
|wir      |wissen|
|ihr      |wisst |
|sie/Sie  |wissen|


English speakers often confuse _wissen_ with _kennen_, because both translate to "to know":

*   Ich weiß nichts! (I know nothing!)
*   Ich kenne ihn. (I know him.)

_Kennen_ is generally used to express familiarity: you know it exists, or how it is.

_Wissen_ is generally used for facts. It often is used together with verbs (you will learn that later on in this course).

#### Tourist #7 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Tourist/practice) ^

### _Polizei, Türkei_

Nouns ending _\-ei_ are

*   stressed on the last syllable
*   generally feminine: die Polizei, die Türkei

Place names ending in _\-ei_ will thus have an article:

*   die Türkei, die Slowakei

### _Er gefällt mir_

The use of _gefallen_ is unusual:

*   Der Song gefällt mir. (I like the song)

Here, what is liked is the subject (the song), while the person liking it is the dative object. Think "The song is pleasurable to me."

This is mostly used for outward appearance, or style.

#### Household 2 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Household-2/practice) ^

### _Das Handtuch_ (the towel) vs. _das Tuch_ (the cloth)

A _Handtuch_ is a towel, not a hand towel. Of course, a towel can be a hand towel, but this does not mean that the two words are interchangeable. A pet can be a dog, but this does not mean that the words "pet" and "dog" are interchangeable.

#### Food 2 #9 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Food-2/practice) ^

#### _Küche_ vs. _Kuchen_

_Die Küche_ (the kitchen) and _der Kuchen_ (the cake) are often confused by learners. To German ears, they sound quite different. One reason is that in _Küche_, the vowel is short, while the vowel in _Kuchen_ is long.


|singular  |plural    |
|----------|----------|
|die Küche |die Küchen|
|der Kuchen|die Kuchen|


_Kochen_ (to cook) also has a short vowel.

#### _Schmecken_

_Schmecken_ is very similar to the English word "to taste":

*   Ich schmecke Knoblauch! (I taste garlic!)
*   Knoblauch schmeckt super! (Garlic tastes great!)

In addition, _schmecken_ can be used by itself:

*   Die Pizza schmeckt nicht! (The pizza does not taste _good_!)

### Some popular food

#### _Müsli_

_Müsli_ originally refers to "Bircher Müesli", a Swiss breakfast dish, based on rolled oats and fresh or dried fruits.

Nowadays, people will use it for all kinds of cereals or granola, often with high sugar content.

#### _Hähnchen_

_Hähnchen_ usually refers to a chicken that has been turned into a dish. While derived from the word for "male chicken" (_der Hahn_), the only distinction today is that it is a food item.

Remember that words ending in _\-chen_ are always neuter: _das Hähnchen_.

#### _Salat_

_Salat_ can refer to the dish, as well as to the green leaves (usually lettuce) that often go into it.

#### Health #3 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Health/practice) ^

### _Lebensmittel_

_Das Lebensmittel_ (though normally used in plural) refers to anything that can be eaten or drunk.

### _Pommes frites_

The French word for French fries (which are actually from Belgium) is "pommes frites" (literally "fried apple" - don't ask :). German took this, and pronounces it the French way (without the _\-es_). However, in common language, it got shortened to either "Pommes" or "Fritten", which are pronounced like regular German words.

A short word on the audio that goes with the sentences: these are recordings of a computer voice, and sometimes off. Please report any errors! But experience shows that it can take a long time for these to get corrected (there's nothing we, the course creators, can do about it).

### _Scheibe_

_Die Scheibe_ (slice) is mostly used for bread, cheese and sausage, but also for window panes. Otherwise, use _das Stück_ (piece):

*   eine Scheibe Käse (a slice of cheese)
*   ein Stück Fleisch (a piece of meat)

### Reflexive verbs

Many European languages use so-called "reflexive verbs". Think of "I see myself in the mirror". In the same way, German would say:

*   Ich interessiere mich für Musik. (I interest myself in music.)

We teach these in more depth later on, but here is a list of pronouns that are used for them here:


|Nom.   |Acc.   |Acc. reflexive|
|-------|-------|--------------|
|ich    |mich   |mich          |
|du     |dich   |dich          |
|er     |ihn    |sich          |
|es     |es     |sich          |
|sie    |sie    |sich          |
|wir    |uns    |uns           |
|ihr    |euch   |euch          |
|sie/Sie|sie/Sie|sich          |


Notice how they are the same as the normal accusative pronouns, with one difference: All third persons will just use _sich_.

*   Er wäscht sich. (He washes himself.)
*   Er wäscht ihn. (He washes him.)

The reflexive verbs taught here are:

*   sich kümmern um (to take care of)
*   sich freuen auf (to look forward to)

Reflexive verbs should generally be learned together with the preposition they use.

### _Denn_

One way to say "because" in German is _denn_:

*   Ich möchte schlafen, denn ich bin müde. (I want to sleep, because I am tired.)

This is straightforward. However, German more commonly uses _weil_ instead, which you will learn soon. _Weil_ is harder to use, because it changes the position of the verb. But if you always use _denn_, your German will sound slightly stiff.

### _Krankheit, Gesundheit_

A common way to create nouns from adjectives is to add _\-heit_ or _\-keit_ to them. These will always be feminine.

*   krank, die Krank_heit_ (ill, the illness)
*   gesund, die Gesund_heit_ (healthy, the health)

#### Sports 1 #5 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Sports-1/practice) ^

### _Schon wieder_

_Wieder_ means _again_:

*   Ich bin wieder da! (I am there again!)

German often uses _schon wieder_ instead, to stress that something happened "again and again", or that it already happened again.

*   Was, du bist schon wieder da? (What, you are there AGAIN?, or "What, you are already back?")

### _Erlauben_

_Erlauben_ means "to allow". It takes the dative:

*   Ich erlaube es _ihm_. (Literally, I allow it to him.)

#### Celebrate #3 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Celebrate/practice) ^

### A1!

It's time for a little celebration: you have now covered all the material for the A1 level of German! That means you have encountered all the words and grammatical structures for the Beginner level.

According to the CEFR standard, there are six levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). Duolingo aims to teach up to B1, where you can deal with most simple situations in daily life.

Of course, just by arriving at this point does not mean you have now mastered all the material! Go back to the previous skills, try to level up, check the Tips & Notes again.

Also, try to find other ways to practice German. You could find a language exchange; or you could find material online or in your library.

### The rest of the course

The remaining course does not conform to CEFR so far. We are working on it though!

### We want your feedback!

Please be sure to leave feedback in the forum, and in the sentence discussions, so we can continue to improve this course.

#### Adjectives: Predicative 3 #2 · 2019-01-21[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Predicative-3/practice) ^

### Common adjective endings

#### _\-ig_, _\-lich_, _\-isch_

Here are three common endings, which sound very similar:

*   _\-ig_ (roughly like _\-y_ in English): eindeutig, abhängig, …
*   _\-lich_ (roughly _\-ly_ in English): nützlich, möglich, persönlich, …
*   _\-isch_ (roughly _\-ic(al)_ in English): praktisch, logisch, …

The first two sound the same in regular speech (in some dialects, all three sound the same). You already encountered this with the numbers (zwanz_ig_).

When you add an ending to the _\-ig_ adjectives, it will no longer sound like _ch_:

*   eindeuti_g_: die eindeuti_ge_ … (now sounds like _g_)
*   mögli_ch_: der mögli_che_ … (still sounds like _ch_)

#### _\-bar_

_\-bar_ often corresponds to "-(a)ble" in English:

*   sicht_bar_ (visi_ble_)
*   verfüg_bar_ (avail_able_)

Yes, there are lots of bars with joke adjective names in Germany :)

#### _\-los_, _\-voll_

These correspond to English "-less" and "-ful".

*   hoffnungs_voll_ (hope_ful_)
*   hoffnungs_los_ (hope_less_)

### _\-tion_

In English, the "-tion" ending is pronounced "-shen". In German, it always becomes "-tsion". It will always be the emphasized syllable, and the word will always be feminine.

*   Kommunika_tion_, Lek_tion_, Na_tion_

Similarly, _der Patient_ will sound like "der Patsient".

When nouns ending in _\-tion_ are used in an adjective, the ending _\-al_ (or _\-ell_) will be used. The resulting adjective will be pronounced on the last syllable:

*   internation_al_, ration_al_, kommun_al_, sensation_ell_, …

#### Verbs: Present 2 #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Present-2/practice) ^

### _Wissen_ vs. _kennen_

_Wissen_ and _kennen_ both translate to "to know" in English. _Können_ (to be able to) can also mean "to know" in certain contexts.

*   Ich _weiß_ (es) nicht. (I don't know.)
*   Ich _kenne_ ihn nicht. (I don't know him.)
*   Ich _kann_ ein bisschen Polnisch. (I know a bit of Polish.)

So how to know which one to use?

#### _Kennen_

_Kennen_ is used when talking about people, places and the like. It means that you are aware of its existence. _Kennen_ needs an object.

*   Ich _kenne_ diesen Mann nicht! (I don't know this man!)

#### _Wissen_

_Wissen_ is used for knowledge about something. It usually does not have an object. Commonly, it is used with a subordinate clause ("Nebensatz"):

*   Ich _weiß_, wer du bist! (I know who you are.)
*   Ich _weiß_ nicht, wann sie kommt. (I don't know when she arrives.)
*   Er weiß, dass ich ihn liebe. (He knows that I love him.)

In rare cases, _wissen_ _can_ be used with an object, which might lead to very subtle situations like this:

*   Ich _kenne_ dieses Wort nicht (I don't know this word.)
*   Ich _weiß_ dieses Wort nicht. (I don't know this word.)

In the first example, you have never seen this word before. In the second example, you have seen it, but you don't know what it means.

#### _Können_

_Können_ generally means "be able to", and is generally used like "can/be able to" in English. The only confusing thing is that it can take a language instead of an infinitive, which English cannot:

*   Ich _kann_ tanzen (I can dance.)
*   Ich _kann_ Deutsch (I can _speak_ German.)

#### Conjugation of _wissen_

We already used a range of **verbs that change the vowel in the second and third person singular**:


|person   |fahren|lesen|essen|
|---------|------|-----|-----|
|ich      |fahre |lese |esse |
|du       |fährst|liest|isst |
|er/sie/es|fährt |liest|isst |
|wir      |fahren|lesen|essen|
|ihr      |fahrt |lest |esst |
|sie/Sie  |fahren|lesen|essen|


You also encountered modal verbs which generally have a different vowel in singular and plural, respectively. They also have a simpler (and the same) ending in the first and third person singular.

_Wissen_ (to know) is a full verb. However, it is one of the very few full verbs that conjugates like a modal verb:


|pronoun  |wollen|mögen|wissen|
|---------|------|-----|------|
|ich      |will  |mag  |weiß  |
|du       |willst|magst|weißt |
|er/sie/es|will  |mag  |weiß  |
|wir      |wollen|mögen|wissen|
|ihr      |wollt |mögt |wisst |
|sie      |wollen|mögen|wissen|


### Non-stressed prefixes

You already noticed that in German, some verb prefixes can split off:

*   _an_kommen — Ich komme an.
*   _ein_kaufen — Er kauft ein.

The general rule is: **if the prefix is stressed, it splits off**.

How to know which ones are stressed?

It might be easiest to remember those that are never stressed. The most important ones are:

*   _be-, ent-, er-, ver-, zer-_

If you encounter a different prefix, guessing that it splits off will most likely be correct.

### _Gefallen_

So far, you have learned two ways to say "I like".

_Mögen_ is used with nouns:

*   Ich _mag_ Schokolade! (I like chocolate!)

_Gern(e)_ is an adverb that modifies a verb:

*   Ich esse _gerne_ Schokolade. (I like to eat chocolate.)
*   Ich lerne _gerne_ Deutsch. (I like to learn German.)
*   Ich kaufe _gerne_ ein. (I like to go shopping.)

In this lesson, you learn a third way: _gefallen_.

*   Er _gefällt_ mir. (I like him.)

What's going on?! Literally, it means "He is-pleasing to me." That's why "him" become the subject, and "I" becomes the Dative object in the example above.

_Gefallen_ is normally used if you like the look, sound or feel of something:

*   Die Songs _gefallen_ mir. (I like the songs.)
*   Das Haus _gefällt_ uns. (We like the house.)

Like _mögen_, you would only use it with nouns (not with verbs).

### _Legen_ vs. _liegen_

Earlier, you learned the verb _legen_:

*   Ich _lege_ den Ball auf den Tisch. (I put the ball on(to) the table.)

_Liegen_ is related, but defines a position:

*   Der Ball _liegt_ auf dem Tisch (The ball is on the table.)

_Legen_ roughly corresponds to "lay", _liegen_ to "lie".

#### Home 2 #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Home-2/practice) ^

### _Das Handtuch_ (the towel) vs. _das Tuch_ (the cloth)

A _Handtuch_ is a towel, not a hand towel. Of course, a towel can be a hand towel, but this does not mean that the two words are interchangeable. A pet can be a dog, but this does not mean that the words "pet" and "dog" are interchangeable.

#### Verbs Future 1 #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Future-1/practice) ^

### _Werden_ + Infinitiv = Futur

German **normally uses the present tense to indicate the future**.

*   Ich _gehe_ morgen ins Kino. (I _will go_ to the movies tomorrow.)

On some occasions (for example when **making promises or predictions**), German _does_ use a **future tense**. It is very similar to the one in English.

The future tense consists of a **conjugated form of _werden_ in the present tense and an infinitive** (the base form of the verb).


|German                |English            |
|----------------------|-------------------|
|ich werde spielen     |I will play        |
|du wirst spielen      |you will play      |
|er/sie/es wird spielen|he/she/it will play|
|wir werden spielen    |we will play       |
|ihr werdet spielen    |you will play      |
|sie/Sie werden spielen|they/you will play |


Depending on the context, _ich werde spielen_ translates to "I will play" or "I am going to play". In German, there is no distinction between "will" and "going to".

Be aware that the German verb **_wollen_** (to want) is a **false friend of the English _will_**:

*   Ich _will_ spielen! (I _want to_ play!)

### _Werden_ has three different functions

Using _werden_ can be confusing for learners. However, there are **clear distinctions between its three main uses**:

#### _Werden_ + adjective/noun = "to become"

If _werden_ is used **in combination with an adjective or noun**, the meaning will be **"to become" or "to get"**:

*   Sie _wird_ Mutter. (She's becoming a mother.)
*   Ich _werde_ müde. (I'm getting tired.)

The German word _bekommen_ is a confusing false friend to "become":

*   Sie _bekommt_ eine Tochter. (She's getting a daughter.)

#### _Werden_ + Infinitiv = Futur

This case is explained above.

#### _Werden_ + past participle = passive

If used **in combination with a participle**, _werden_ creates one type of **passive**:

*   Der Taxifahrer fährt den Fahrgast. (The taxi driver drives the passenger.)
*   Der Fahrgast _wird_ _gefahren_. (The passenger is being driven.)

#### Pets #5 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Pets/practice) ^

### _Fressen_ vs. _essen_

The German word for "to eat" is _essen_. However, many people use a different word for animals:

*   Die Frau isst. Die Katze frisst.

The forms of both verbs are the same:


|person     |essen   |fressen  |
|-----------|--------|---------|
|ich        |esse    |fresse   |
|du         |isst    |frisst   |
|er/sie/es  |isst    |frisst   |
|wir        |essen   |fressen  |
|ihr        |esst    |fresst   |
|sie/Sie    |essen   |fressen  |
|perf. part.|gegessen|gefressen|


### Natural vs. grammatical gender

Remember that for most nouns in German, the word determines the gender, not the meaning:

*   _der_ Becher, _die_ Tasse, _das_ Glas (the mug, the cup, the glass)

For animals, there is usually a general word with a certain grammatical gender. "Katze" is feminine. That does not mean that the specific cat is necessarily female!

*   die: Katze, Spinne, Schildkröte, Schlange, Kuh, Maus
*   der: Hamster, Hund, Vogel
*   das: Insekt, Huhn, Tier, Schaf, Schwein, Pferd, Kaninchen

German has specific male/female versions for some of these, but we do not teach them at this point.

### Favorite

_Liebling_ means "darling":

*   Mein Liebling! (My darling!)

When combined with other nouns, it means "favorite":

*   meine Liebling_s_katze (my favorite cat)

Note that German often glues an "s" or an "n" between two noun word parts.

### _Danken_

Similar to _helfen_ (to help), _danken_ is part of a small number of verbs that only have a dative object:

*   Ich helfe dem Mann.
*   Ich danke dem Mann.

Think of "giving help/thanks to" somebody, and you will get it right.

### _Angst haben_

Instead of "to be afraid of", German says "I have fear of":

*   Ich _habe Angst vor_ Hunden. (I am afraid of dogs.)

It is sometimes necessary to learn the preposition together with the verb. _Vor_ takes the dative when used together with _Angst haben_.

#### Passport #3 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Passport/practice) ^

### Yes/No Questions

Questions can be asked by **switching the subject and verb**. For instance,

*   _Du verstehst_ das. (You understand this.)

becomes

*   _Verstehst du_ das? (Do you understand this?).

These kinds of questions will generally just elicit yes/no answers. In English, the main verb "to be" follows the same principle. "You are hungry." becomes "Are you hungry?".

In German, all verbs follow this principle. **There's no do-support**.

### Asking a Question in German With a W-Word

There are seven W-questions in German:


|English|German |
|-------|-------|
|what   |was    |
|who    |wer    |
|where  |wo     |
|when   |wann   |
|how    |wie    |
|why    |warum  |
|which  |welcher|


Don't mix up _wer_ and _wo_, which are "switched" in English :)

Some of these will change according to case.

#### _Was_ (what)

If you ask _was_ with a preposition, the two normally turn into a new word, according to the following pattern:


|English   |preposition|wo-    |
|----------|-----------|-------|
|for what  |für        |wofür  |
|about what|über       |worüber|
|with what |mit        |womit  |


If the preposition starts with a vowel, there will be an extra _\-r-_ to make it easier to pronounce.

This _wo-_ prefix does **not** mean "where".

#### _Wer_ (who)

_Wer_ is declinable and needs to **adjust to the cases**. The adjustment depends on what the question is targeting.

If you ask for the subject of a sentence (i.e. the nominative object), _wer_ (who) remains as is:

*   _Wer_ ist da? (Who is there?).

If you ask for the direct (accusative) object in a sentence, _wer_ changes to _wen_ (who/whom). As a mnemonic, notice how _wen_ rhymes with _den_ in _den Apfel_.

*   _Wen_ siehst du? — Ich sehe _den_ Hund.
*   (Whom do you see? — I see the dog.)

You will soon learn about the Dative case. You have to use _wem_ then. And there is a forth case in German (Genitive). You would use _wessen_ here. This corresponds to English "whose".

The endings look like the endings of _der_ (but don't change with gender/number):


|case      |masc.|Form of wer|
|----------|-----|-----------|
|nominative|der  |wer        |
|accusative|den  |wen        |
|dative    |dem  |wem        |


#### _Welche(r/s)_ (which)

_Welche-_ words are used to ask about for a specific item out of a group of items, such as "which car is yours?".

This declines not only for case, but also for gender. The endings are the same as for definite articles:


|article  |welch* |
|---------|-------|
|der      |welcher|
|das      |welches|
|die      |welche |
|die (pl.)|welche |
|den      |welchen|


#### _Wo_ (where)

In German, you can inquire about locations in several ways.

_Wo_ (where) is the general question word, but if you are **asking for a direction** in which someone or something is moving, you may **use \*wohin**\* (where to).

Consider these examples:

*   _Wo_ ist mein Schuh? (Where is my shoe?)
    
*   _Wohin_ gehst du? (Where are you going (to)?)
    

Furthermore, _wohin_ is separable into _wo_ + _hin_:

*   _Wo_ ist mein Schuh _hin_? (Where did my shoe go?)

The same goes for _woher_ (where from):

*   _Woher_ kommst du? (Where are you from)

might become

*   _Wo_ kommst du _her_?


|English   |German|
|----------|------|
|where     |wo    |
|where to  |wohin |
|where from|woher |


#### _Wann_ (when)

_Wann_ (when) does not change depending on the case. _Wann_ can be used with conjunctions such as _seit_ (since) or _bis_ (till):

*   _Seit wann_ wartest du? (Since when have you been waiting?)
    
*   _Bis wann_ geht der Film? (Till when does the movie last?).
    

Don't confuse _w**a**nn_ with _w**e**nn_ which you learned in Conjunctions. Both translate to "when" in English, but they have different functions in German.

*   _W**a**nn_ kommst du? (When are you coming?)
    
*   Ich schlafe nicht, _w**e**nn_ ich Musik höre. (I don't sleep when I listen to music)
    

#### _Warum_ (why)

_Warum_ (why) is also not declinable. It will never change endings. _Wieso_, _Weshalb_, and _Weswegen_ can be used instead of _Warum_. There's no difference in meaning.

Here is an example. All four following sentences mean "Why is the car so old?".

*   _Warum_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Wieso_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Weshalb_ ist das Auto so alt?
    
*   _Weswegen_ ist das Auto so alt?
    

#### _Wie viel_ vs. _wie viele_

_Wie viel_ is used with uncountable or countable nouns (how much/how many), and **_wie viele_ is only used with countable nouns** (how many). Some people think that "wie viel" can only be used with uncountable nouns, but that is not true.

*   _Wie viel_ Milch trinkst du? (How much milk do you drink?)
    
*   _Wie viel(e)_ Tiere siehst du? (How many animals do you see?)
    

#### Verbs: Modal #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Modal/practice) ^

### Modal verbs

#### Verb forms

You have already encountered some modal verbs earlier in the course:


|pronoun  |wollen|mögen|können|
|---------|------|-----|------|
|ich      |will  |mag  |kann  |
|du       |willst|magst|kannst|
|er/sie/es|will  |mag  |kann  |
|wir      |wollen|mögen|können|
|ihr      |wollt |mögt |könnt |
|sie      |wollen|mögen|können|


To help remember the conjugated forms, note that modal verbs are the **same in the first and third person singular**.

They also often change their vowel. The **vowel in the singular will be different** from the vowel of the infinitive.

#### Forms of _müssen_, _sollen_, _wollen_, _dürfen_, _möchten_

In this lesson, you will learn the **remaining modal verbs**.

Consider these three - two new modal verbs as compared to the familiar _wollen_:


|pronoun  |müssen|dürfen|wollen|
|---------|------|------|------|
|ich      |muss  |darf  |will  |
|du       |musst |darfst|willst|
|er/sie/es|muss  |darf  |will  |
|wir      |müssen|dürfen|wollen|
|ihr      |müsst |dürft |wollt |
|sie      |müssen|dürfen|wollen|


As in _können_ und _wollen_, the vowel in the singular is different. The first and third person are the same in the plural **and** in the singular (unlike normal verbs).

Here are the last two new modal verbs:


|pronoun  |sollen|möchten |
|---------|------|--------|
|ich      |soll  |möchte  |
|du       |sollst|möchtest|
|er/sie/es|soll  |möchte  |
|wir      |sollen|möchten |
|ihr      |sollt |möchtet |
|sie      |sollen|möchten |


**_sollen_ does not change its vowel**. Its meaning is roughly like "shall".

**_möchten_ is unusual**. It is actually the subjunctive form of "mögen", which is why it has the same ending system as subjunctive and past tense verbs. You will learn about those later in the course.

If you remember that _mögen_ translates to "like" in English, it makes perfect sense that its subjunctive **_möchten_ means "would like to"**.

*   Ich _mag_ Pizza. (I _like_ Pizza.)
*   Ich _möchte_ Pizza. (I _would like_ (to eat) Pizza.)

#### How to use modal verbs

As in English, **modal verbs are combined with the infinitive of a verb**:

*   Ich schwimme. Ich _kann schwimmen_. (I swim. I can swim.)

Because of the peculiarity of German sentence structure, the **infinitive verb will appear at the end** in a normal sentence:

*   Ich **muss** jeden Tag **arbeiten**. (I have to work every day.)

#### _Müssen_ vs. _dürfen_

A common problem for English speakers learning German is to **use _müssen_ right**. Here's the problem:

*   Ich _muss_ schlafen. (I _must_ sleep.)
*   Ich _muss nicht_ schlafen. (I _don't need to_ sleep.)

Actually, the problem is in English. Let's look at the same example again, but use "have to" instead:

*   Ich _muss_ schlafen. (I _have to_ sleep.)
*   Ich _muss nicht_ schlafen. (I _don't have to_ sleep.)

As you can see, if you **think "have to" instead of "must"**, you'll be fine.

But how to say "must not"?

*   Ich _darf nicht_ schlafen. (I must not sleep.)
*   Ich _darf_ schlafen. (I'm allowed to sleep.)

As you can see, **_dürfen_ works pretty much like "may"** in English.

*   _Darf ich_? (_May I_?)
*   Nein, du _darfst nicht_. (No, you _may not_.)
*   Oh, schade.

#### Genitive Case #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Genitive-Case/practice) ^

The genitive case
-----------------

The genitive case is used to **indicate possession**.

*   Das Fahrrad _des Mannes_ ist schwarz. (The man's bike is black.)
    
*   Das Fahrrad _des Kindes_ ist blau. (The kid's bike is blue.)
    
*   Das Fahrrad _der Frau_ ist grün. (The woman's bike is green.)
    
*   Das Fahrrad _der Männer/der Kinder/der Frauen_ ist rot. (The people's bike is red.)
    


|    |masc.|neut.|fem.|plural|
|----|-----|-----|----|------|
|nom.|der  |das  |die |die   |
|acc.|den  |das  |die |die   |
|dat.|dem  |dem  |der |den   |
|gen.|des  |des  |der |der   |


Das Fahrrad _eines Mannes_ ist schwarz.

Das Fahrrad _eines Kindes_ ist blau.

Das Fahrrad _einer Frau_ ist grün.


|          |masculine|neuter|feminine|
|----------|---------|------|--------|
|nominative|ein      |ein   |eine    |
|accusative|einen    |ein   |eine    |
|dative    |einem    |einem |einer   |
|genitive  |eines    |eines |einer   |


### Nouns

**Nouns consisting of one syllable tend to add _\-es_ in the masculine and neuter**. The ending is often reduced to just _\-s_, especially in colloquial speech.

*   der Hund, de**s** Hund**es**

Nouns consisting of **more than one syllable, tend to add just _\-s_**.

*   der Computer, de**s** Computer**s**

**Weak nouns add _\-n_ or _\-en_** in the genitive as well (all cases but the nominative), e.g. _des Jungen_ and _des Studenten_. Check the lesson "Dative Case" for a discussion of these nouns.

### Genitive phrases have a fixed word order

You can say _das Fahrrad des Kindes_, but **you cannot say _des Kindes Fahrrad_**. The latter word order used to be acceptable hundreds of years ago, and you may still occasionally find it in poetry, but it’s no longer used in contemporary Standard German.

### Proper names

In contrast to common nouns, **proper names precede the noun**.

*   Peter_s_ Fahrrad ist neu.

Do not add an apostrophe unless the name already ends in _\-s_ or _\-z_. In the latter case, the apostrophe comes at the very end of the name.

*   _Hans’_ Fahrrad ist alt.

### Adjectives

**Adjectives in the genitive case end in _\-en_**. The only **exception are feminine and plural, without article** (feminine without article is quite rare).


|                   |preceded by an article              |not preceded by an article|
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|masculine          |das Fahrrad des/eines großen Mannes |wegen großen Bedarfs      |
|feminine           |das Fahrrad der/einer kleinen Frau  |trotz großer Freude       |
|neuter             |das Fahrrad des/eines kleinen Kindes|trotz ruhigen Wesens      |
|plural (any gender)|das Fahrrad der kleinen Kinder      |wegen neuer Informationen |


### Prepositions that take the genitive case

The most common **prepositions that take the genitive** case are:


|German  |English   |
|--------|----------|
|anstatt |instead of|
|statt   |instead of|
|aufgrund|because of|
|trotz   |despite   |
|während |during    |
|wegen   |because of|


In colloquial speech, some prepositions that traditionally take the genitive tend to take the dative nowadays.

*   Trotz _des_ Regen_s_ spielt er Fußball. (Genitive)
*   Trotz _dem_ Regen spielt er Fußball. (Dative)

### Verbs that take the genitive case

There’s a small set of verbs that take the genitive. Most of them are not used a lot in everyday speech and they may sound a bit stilted.

### The dative as an alternative

As an **alternative for the genitive**, you can often use **_von_ followed by the dative case**. Here are some examples:


|genitive             |dative                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|
|der Ball der Frau    |der Ball von der Frau   |
|der Ball des Mädchens|der Ball von dem Mädchen|
|der Ball des Mannes  |der Ball von dem Mann   |
|der Ball der Kinder  |der Ball von den Kindern|
|Peters Ball          |der Ball von Peter      |


Often, the genitive case will be preferred in written language, with colloquial language going more for the dative case.

#### Formal You #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Formal-you/practice) ^

Surprise! There's another way of addressing people. The good news is: it's super easy. Just use the "they" forms when talking to people you're not close with.

Need more details? Then read on :)

### German You: Who are you talking to?

In English, "you" can be either singular or plural, and no distinction is made between formal and informal. In German, there are **three ways of saying "you"**.

#### _Du_

If you are **_familiar_ with someone, you use _du_** (which is called "duzen"). For example, if you talk to your mother, you would say:

*   "Hast _du_ jetzt Zeit, Mama?" (Do you have time now, Mommy?).

Use this form for family members, co-students, children and young adults.

#### _Ihr_

If you **refer to more than one person, you use _ihr_**. This is also a "familiar" form, so use it in the same settings as _du_.

The German _ihr_ you learned earlier is the **informal plural** of "you," like in

*   Hans und Karl, habt ihr Zeit? (Hans and Karl, do you have time?)

#### _Sie_ (formal you)

If you are **not familiar** with someone or still wish to stay **formal and express respect**, you use _Sie_ (so-called "siezen"). For example, you would always address your professor like this:

*   Haben _Sie_ jetzt Zeit, Herr Schmidt? (Do you have time now, Mr. Schmidt?)

_Sie_ is also used for multiple people. But you can't translate it well with "you all" or "you guys", because that would sound too informal.

Here are the three forms of "you", and "they" for comparison:


|English person         |ending|German example|
|-----------------------|------|--------------|
|you (singular informal)|-st   |du trinkst    |
|you (plural informal)  |-t    |ihr trinkt    |
|you (formal)           |-en   |Sie trinken   |
|they                   |-en   |sie trinken   |


When spoken, **"they" and formal "you" are identical**. So, in a way, Germans formally address people like "How are they today?"

#### How do you know if _sie_ means "she", "they", or "you"?

You can distinguish the formal _Sie_ from the plural _sie_ (they) because the **formal _Sie_ will always be capitalized**. However, it will remain ambiguous at the beginning of written sentences.

For instance, _Sie sind schön._ can either refer to a beautiful individual or a group of beautiful people. The verbs for _sie_ (they) and _Sie_ (you) are conjugated the same. On Duolingo, either should be accepted unless the context suggests otherwise. In real life, there's always context. Don't worry about misunderstandings.

Fortunately, the **verb for _sie_ (she) is different**. _Sie ist schön._ only translates to "She is beautiful." There's no ambiguity.

#### Other formal "you"s

There are more ways to address people formally in German, but they are not in common use and/or outdated, so we don't support them in this course. You might encounter them in Middle Ages reenactments or so :)

The _third person singular_ was used:

*   Hat _er_ heute gut geschlafen? (literally, "Has _he_ slept well today?")

The _second person plural_ was also used, and is still used locally:

*   _Ihr_ habt einen schönen Hut. (literally, "_You all_ have a nice hat.")

#### You will encounter the informal you in this skill as well

As some of the sentences in this skill are shared among multiple skills, you will encounter the informal you in this skill as well. For technical reasons, this cannot be changed at this point. Please do not send a report regarding this issue.

#### Occupation 2 #2 · 2018-10-28[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Occupation-2/practice) ^

### _Student_ or _Schüler_?

A _Student_ is a university student and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### Dropping articles

When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as _I'm a teacher_ or _She's a judge_, German speakers **usually drop the indefinite article** _(ein/eine)_. It sounds more natural to say _Ich bin Lehrer_ and _Sie ist Richterin_ than _Ich bin ein Lehrer_ and _Sie ist eine Richterin_. This rule also applies to students.

If you add an adjective, you can't drop the article. _Er ist ein schlechter Arzt_ (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but _Er ist schlechter Arzt_ is not.

Also note that **you can't drop the definite article** _(der/die/das)_.

### Male and female variants

The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to, i.e. the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically feminine. In the vast majority of cases, **the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix _\-in_ to the male variant**, e.g. _der Bäcker_ becomes _die Bäckerin_ and _der Schüler_ (the pupil) becomes _die Schülerin_.

**The plural __of the female variant__ is formed by adding the suffix _\-innen_** to the singular of the male variant, e.g. _die Bäcker**innen**_ and _die Schüler**innen**_.

Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female variant as well, e.g. _der K**o**ch_ becomes _die K**ö**che_ and _die K**ö**chin_ becomes _die K**ö**chinnen_.

#### Verbs: Perfect 1 #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Perfect-1/practice) ^

### When is the _Perfekt_ used?

The _Perfekt_ is used to describe past events. In spoken German, the _Perfekt_ is preferred over the _Präteritum_. Using the _Präteritum_ in normal conversation may sound unnatural or pretentious.

*   Gestern _habe_ ich Pizza _gegessen_. (Yesterday, I _ate_ pizza.)

In contrast to the English _present perfect_, the German _Perfekt_ is not used to describe events that started in the past and are still ongoing. In such cases, German speakers use the _present tense_:

*   Ich lebe seit drei Jahren hier. (I have been living here for three years.)

#### Verbs mostly used in _Präteritum_

The following verbs are normally not used in the _Perfekt_. Use _Präteritum_ instead.


|English|Verb  |Präteritum|
|-------|------|----------|
|to be  |sein  |ich war   |
|to have|haben |ich hatte |
|to know|wissen|ich wusste|
|may    |dürfen|ich durfte|
|can    |können|ich konnte|
|must   |müssen|ich musste|
|shall  |sollen|ich sollte|
|want to|wollen|ich wollte|


### How is _Perfekt_ formed?

The _Perfekt_ is formed by combining a conjugated form of _haben_ (to have) or _sein_ (to be) in the present tense with the past participle of the main verb.

*   Gestern _hat_ er nur zwei Stunden _geschlafen_. (Yesterday, he only _slept_ for two hours.)

#### When to use _sein_

The vast majority of verbs take _haben_ (just like in English).

Verbs that indicate a motion normally take _sein_ as a helper verb. Here are some common examples:


|Infinitiv|Perfekt            |
|---------|-------------------|
|gehen    |ich bin gegangen   |
|laufen   |ich bin gelaufen   |
|rennen   |ich bin gerannt    |
|schwimmen|ich bin geschwommen|
|fliegen  |ich bin geflogen   |


However, verbs that indicate some other change also take _sein_:


|Infinitiv                |Perfekt              |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
|aufwachen (wake up)      |ich bin aufgewacht   |
|einschlafen (fall asleep)|ich bin eingeschlafen|
|sterben (die)            |er ist gestorben     |


There are a few other verbs, for example

*   bleiben (to stay) - ich _bin_ geblieben
*   passieren (to happen) - es _ist_ passiert

None of these verbs have an object (they are "intransitive"). If they have a variant with an object ("transitive"), they take _haben_:

*   Ich _bin_ im Auto gefahren. (fahren: movement)
*   Ich _habe_ _das Auto_ _gefahren_. (you operate the car. The movement is secondary)
*   Ich _bin_ _Auto gefahren_. (_Auto_ is NOT an object here. It's a complement, like _Deutsch lernen_, similar to _ein|kaufen_

#### How to form the participle

##### Regular verbs

**Most verbs are regular** (these are called "weak"). For these, creating the perfect participle is easy. Just add _ge-_ to the front, and replace the infinitive ending with _\-(e)t_:

*   machen - **ge**mach**t**
*   arbei**t**en - **ge**arbeit**et**

##### Irregular verbs

German has a number of irregular verbs. Most of these are "strong" verbs. For these, you add _ge-_, but you add _\-en_. There might be a vowel change involved. Rarely, the change in the word stem is more drastic.


|Infinitiv|Partizip II|
|---------|-----------|
|schlafen |geschlafen |
|trinken  |getrunken  |
|schwimmen|geschwommen|
|essen    |gegessen   |
|gehen    |gegangen   |


While most verbs are weak, **many of the most common verbs are strong**.

There is a small group of irregular verbs that follow a different system (called "**mixed verbs**"). Here are most of them:


|Infinitiv|Partizip II|
|---------|-----------|
|wissen   |gewusst    |
|rennen   |gerannt    |
|brennen  |gebrannt   |
|kennen   |gekannt    |
|denken   |gedacht    |
|bringen  |gebracht   |


##### Why is there no _ge-_? Why is it inside the participle?

Once you have the correct form of the basic verb, here are two more rules you need to know:

German verbs have two kinds of prefixes. Some can split off. These are always emphasized:

*   (**ein**_kaufen_) Ich _kaufe_ im Supermarkt **ein**.

Verbs like this will have the _\-ge-_ between the prefix and the verb stem:

*   Ich habe im Supermarkt ein**ge**kauft.
*   Ich bin im Bus ein**ge**schlafen.

Here are some common prefixes that are always emphasized:

*   ab-, an-, auf-, aus-, bei-, ein-, mit-, nach-, vor-, zu-

Other prefixes are not emphasized. They never split off. For these (and any other **verbs that are not emphasized on the first syllable), do not add a _ge-_ prefix**. This includes all verbs that end in _\-ieren_ (as these are emphasized at the _\-ie-_).

*   (**ver**kaufen) Ich verkaufe mein Auto
*   Ich habe mein Auto **verkauft**.
*   Ich habe gestern **verschlafen**.
*   Er hat Musik **studiert**.

These prefixes are never emphasized:

*   be-, ent-, er-, ge-, ver-, zer-

A few prefixes might be emphasized or not.

#### Adjectives: Nominative 1 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Nominative-1/practice) ^

### Adjective endings

When an adjective comes before a noun, its ending will change according to this noun.

*   Die Katze ist _alt_.
    
*   Das ist eine _alt**e**_ Katze.
    

#### Article + Adjective

You can think of the adjective endings as "markers", that kind of mark what part of speech the adjective belongs to.

##### Nominative

Remember that the nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. These are the **nominative adjectives**:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |der    |rote     |Hut   |
|      |ein    |roter    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


While that might look a bit chaotic, there is not so much going on:

1) **Masculine**: **Either the article, or the adjective** must have the _\-r_ ending. The same goes for **neuter and _\-s_**

*   De**r** klein**e** Hund spielt.
*   Ein klein**er** Hund spielt.

2) **Feminine and Plural end in _\-e_**. If you **add an article**, you also have to **add an _\-n_**.

*   Di**e** alt**e** Katze schläft.
*   Alt**e** Katzen schlafen.
*   Di**e** alt**en** Katzen schlafen.
*   Das sind **keine** alt**en** Katzen.

#### Adjectives: Accusative #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Accusative/practice) ^

### Accusative adjective endings

Do you remember that quite often, the _accusative looks like the nominative_? Specifically, _only the articles for masculine nouns change_.

The same goes for the adjectives. They are the same as for nominative; the only exception is for masculine nouns. The changes are marked in bold in the table below.

3) **masculine accusative**: adjective ends in _\-en_

*   Die alte Katze schläft. De**r** alt**e** Mann sieht die alte Katze (no change)
*   Die alte Katze sieht de**n** alt**en** Mann.


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |den    |roten    |Hut   |
|      |einen  |roten    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


#### Adjectives: Dative #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Dative/practice) ^

Please refer to the previous lessons on adjectives about the endings for nominative and accusative.

### Dative

Dative, as always, is even simpler.

4) **Dative**: **all adjectives get an _\-en_ ending**


|gender|article|adjective|noun   |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
|masc. |dem    |roten    |Hut    |
|      |einem  |roten    |Hut    |
|neut. |dem    |roten    |Hemd   |
|      |einem  |roten    |Hemd   |
|fem.  |der    |roten    |Rose   |
|      |einer  |roten    |Rose   |
|Plural|den    |roten    |Schuhen|
|      |keinen |roten    |Schuhen|
|      |-      |roten    |Schuhen|


Remember that in dative,

*   masculine/neuter articles end in _\-m_
*   feminine articles end in _\-r_
*   plural articles end in _\-n_
*   and plural nouns (almost) always end in _\-n_.

Here are some examples:

*   Der Mann **mit de_m_ rote_n_ Hem_d_** (the man in the red shirt)
*   Sie mag Männer **mit rote_n_ Haare_n_** (She likes men with red hair)

#### When do dative adjectives not end in _\-n_?

There is a rather rare case when dative adjectives **do not end in _\-en_**.

Rarely, single nouns will be used without any article. This mostly happens in idiomatic expressions.

*   mit heiß**er** Feder (with hot feather)
*   mit groß**em** Eifer (with great verve)

What happens here is that the ending that would normally be used in the article now ends up on the adjective.

#### Plurals #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Plurals/practice) ^

### German plurals

In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding an _\-(e)s_ at the end of the word:

*   the dog, the dog**s**

In German, different nouns have different ways of forming the plural.

Generally, you will probably have to memorize the plurals in the beginning. Later on, your brain will notice regular patterns that are not easily explained.

However, there are some major regularities that are very helpful to know. If you apply these, the task of mastering German plurals will become much easier :)

#### Ending in _\-(e)n_

**All nouns ending in _\-e_**, and **most feminine nouns** will add an _\-(e)n_ ending in the plural.

*   die Frau, die Frau**en**
*   die Ente, die Ente**n**
*   der Junge, die Junge**n**

#### Ending in _\-s_

Most nouns **ending in a full vowel** will add an _\-s_ in the plural.

*   das Sof**a**, die Sofa**s**
*   das Aut**o**, die Auto**s**
*   das Bab**y**, die Baby**s**
*   das Caf**é**, die Café**s**

This does not apply to nouns ending in _\-e_ (which is not a full vowel).

Many of these words are of foreign origin. Some other foreign words will also get the _\-s_ plural:

*   der Chef (the boss), die Chef**s**
*   die Email, die Email**s**
*   der Job, die Job**s**

#### No ending change

There is **no change** for **neuter or masculine** nouns that have **any of these singular endings**:

*   **\-chen, -lein, -el, or -er**.
    
*   das Mädchen, **die** Mädchen
    
*   der Computer, **die** Computer
*   der Löffel (the spoon), **die** Löffel

Some words for close family members will have an umlaut change:

*   der Bruder (the brother), die Br**ü**der

If words with these endings are **feminine, the plural will end in _\-n_**:

*   die Schwester (the sister), die Schwester**n**
*   die Gabel (the fork), die Gabel**n**

#### Ending in _\-e/-er_

Most German **one-syllable nouns** will add an _\-e_ in their plural form. There might be an umlaut change.

*   das Brot (the bread), die Brot**e**
*   der Tisch (the table), die Tisch**e**
*   der Ball (the ball), die B**ä**lle

Many other **masculine or neuter** nouns will need the _\-er_ ending, and there may be umlaut changes.

*   das Kind (the child), die Kind**er**
*   der Mann (the man), die M**ä**nn**er**

### German feminine plurals - nouns ending in _\-in_

Job descriptions are usually masculine:

*   der Koch (the male cook)
*   der Fahrer (the male driver)
*   der Lehrer (the male teacher)
*   der Arzt (the male physician)

To refer to a female, German adds _\-in_:

*   die K**ö**ch**in** (the female cook)
*   die Fahrer**in** (the female driver)
*   die Lehrer**in** (the female teacher)
*   die **Ä**rzt**in** (the female physician)

As you can see, some of these get an umlaut change. The same umlaut change will happen in the plural.

The plural of the masculine forms usually refers to mixed, as well as all-male groups:

*   die K**ö**che (the cooks)
*   die Fahrer (the drivers)
*   die Lehrer (the teachers)
*   die **Ä**rzte (the physicians)

If you want to specify that you are talking about a group consisting of women, use the feminine plural forms. These will add _\-innen_ in the plural.

*   die K**ö**ch**innen**
*   die Fahrer**innen**
*   die Lehrer**innen**
*   die **Ä**rzt**innen**

#### Direction #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Direction/practice) ^

#### _Weg_ vs. _weg_

_Der Weg" (with a long_ e\*) roughly means "the path".

*   _Der Weg_ ist lang. (The path is long.)

_Weg_ (with a short, open _e_) roughly means "away".

Here are some examples:

*   Geh _weg_! (Go away!)
*   Ich bin _weg_! (I'm gone!)

#### Adjectives: Nominative 2 #2 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives:-Nominative-2/practice) ^

### Nominative

Remember that nominative is used for the subject of a sentence. These are the **nominative adjectives**:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |der    |rote     |Hut   |
|      |ein    |roter    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


While that might look a bit chaotic, there is not so much going on:

1) **masculine**: **Either the article, or the adjective** must have the _\-r_ ending. The same goes for **neuter and _\-s_**.

*   De**r** klein**e** Hund spielt.
*   Ein klein**er** Hund spielt.

2) **Feminine and Plural end in _\-e_**. If you **add an article**, you also have to **add an _\-n_**.

*   **Die** alt**e** Katze schläft.
*   Alt**e** Katzen schlafen.
*   **Die** alt**en** Katzen schlafen.
*   Das sind **keine** alt**en** Katzen.

#### Jobs 2 #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Jobs-2/practice) ^

### _Student_ or _Schüler?_

**_Ein Student_ is a university student** and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### Dropping articles

When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as _I'm a teacher_ or _She's a judge_, German speakers **usually drop the indefinite article** _(ein/eine)_.

*   Ich bin Lehrer. (I am **a** teacher.)

It sounds more natural to say _Ich bin Lehrer_ and _Sie ist Richterin_ than _Ich bin ein Lehrer_ and _Sie ist eine Richterin_. This rule also applies to students.

If you **add an adjective**, you **can't drop the article**. _Er ist ein schlechter Arzt_ (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but _Er ist schlechter Arzt_ is not.

Also note that **you can't drop the definite article** _(der/die/das)_.

#### Male and female variants

The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to.

So the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically feminine.

In the vast majority of cases, **the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix _\-in_ to the male variant**, e.g. _der Bäcker_ becomes _die Bäckerin_ and _der Schüler_ (the pupil) becomes _die Schülerin_.

**The plural** of the female variant **is formed by adding the ending _\-innen_** to the singular of the male variant, e.g. _die Bäcker**innen**_ and _die Schüler**innen**_.

Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female variant as well.


|      |singular  |plural       |
|------|----------|-------------|
|male  |der Koch  |die Köche    |
|female|die Köchin|die Köchinnen|


You learn one more word like this in this lesson:

*   der **A**rzt, die **Ä**rztin (the doctor)

#### _Sie ist der Boss!_

There are a few words for people where the grammatical and the natural gender differ. One of them is _der Boss_. There is no feminine version for it, although there are certainly female bosses.

*   **Mein** Boss heißt Linda Ackermann.
*   **Meine** Chef**in** heißt Linda Ackermann.

#### Adverbs A #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adverbs-A/practice) ^

### _Damit_ vs. _damit_

There are two words spelled _damit_ in German.

One is a **combination of a pronoun and a preposition** (_da+mit_). It means **"with that"**.

*   Das ist ein Stift. _Damit_ schreibe ich. (That's a pen. _With that_, I write.)
*   Ich habe ein Deutschzertifikat. _Damit_ kann ich in Deutschland studieren. (I have a German certificate. _With that_, I can study in Germany.)

This word is generally emphasized on the first syllable. As any standard sentence element, if it is used in the first position, the subject will have to go after the verb (which has to be in position 2).

The other is a **subordinating conjunction**. It translates to **"so that"**:

*   Ich kaufe einen Stift, _damit_ ich schreiben **kann**. (I buy a pen _so that_ I can write.)
*   Ich lerne Deutsch, _damit_ ich in Deutschland studieren **kann**. (I learn German _so that_ I can study in Germany.)

Because it creates a subordinate clause, **the verb of that clause has to go to the end**. This version of _damit_ is pronounced at the second syllable.

To remember which is which, remember that the one that's emphasized at the end also sends the verb to the end.

### _Damit, um … zu …, zum …_

There are at least three ways to express a goal.

#### _Zum_

The easiest just takes a simple verb:

*   Ich fahre _zum Skifahren_ nach Japan. (I go to Japan _for_ skiing.)
*   _Zum Lachen_ geht er in den Keller. (He goes to the basement _to_ laugh.)

The verb becomes a noun here, hence the upper-case initial, and the _zum_ (zu+dem) preposition. If a verb turns into a noun, it always gets neuter gender (das Essen, das Lachen).

#### _Um … zu …_

If you have a more complicated verb complex (for example, with adverbs or objects), you cannot use _zum_. Use _um … zu …_ instead:

*   Ich gehe ins Restaurant, _um_ mit Freunden Pizza _zu_ essen. (I go to the restaurant _in order to_ eat pizza with friends.)

To do this, you start with an infinitive construction:

*   _mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein**kaufen**_ (to go shopping in the supermarket with friends)

If you were to use this in a sentence, it would look like this:

*   Ich **kaufe** _mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein_.

The _um_ goes to the beginning of the infinitive construction. The _zu_ goes where the verb part (in the above example, _kaufen_) splits off.

*   Ich fahre in die Stadt, _um_ mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein_zu_kaufen.

#### _Damit_

If your main sentence has a different subject than your goal, you can't use an infinitive. Use _damit_, which comes with a subordinate clause.

*   _Ich_ gebe ihm mein Handy, _damit_ _er_ seine Mutter anrufen kann. (I give him my phone _so that_ he can call his mom)

Read the section "_damit_ vs. _damit_" for more information on how to use it.

### _Womit? Damit!_

Many prepositions can be combined with _wo-_ and _da-_. _Da_ roughly translates to "that" here, _wo_ normally to "what" (not "where" which is its normal meaning).


|wo-       |da-       |
|----------|----------|
|woran     |daran     |
|worauf    |darauf    |
|woraus    |daraus    |
|wobei     |dabei     |
|wodurch   |dadurch   |
|wofür     |dafür     |
|wogegen   |dagegen   |
|wohinter  |dahinter  |
|worin     |darin     |
|womit     |damit     |
|wonach    |danach    |
|worum     |darum     |
|worüber   |darüber   |
|worunter  |darunter  |
|wovon     |davon     |
|wovor     |davor     |
|wozu      |dazu      |
|wozwischen|dazwischen|


If the **preposition starts with a vowel**, there will be a **binding _r_**. So _worum_ is pronounced _wo-rum_ (not _wor-um_).

#### Clothing #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Clothing/practice) ^

#### _Kleider_ - dresses or clothes?

_Das Kleid_ means "the dress", and _die Kleider_ means "the dresses", but the plural _die Kleider_ can also mean "clothes" or "clothing". In most cases, "clothing" (or "clothes") translates to _Kleidung_ (usually uncountable), but it's important to be aware that _Kleider_ can be used in that sense as well.

#### _Hose_ or _Hosen_?

Both _Hose_ and _Hosen_ translate to "pants" ("trousers" in British English), but they're not interchangeable. The singular _Hose_ refers to one pair of pants, and the plural _Hosen_ refers to multiple pairs of pants.

#### Adverbs 3 #5 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adverbs-3/practice) ^

### _Trotzdem_ vs. _obwohl_

_Obwohl_ translates to "although", while _trotzdem_ translates to "however/nevertheless".

*   Ich bin müde, **obwohl** ich Kaffee getrunken _habe_. (I'm tired, although I drank coffee.)
*   Ich habe Kaffee getrunken. **Trotzdem** bin _ich_ müde. (I drank coffee. Nevertheless, I'm tired.)

**_Trotzdem_ is an adverb**. It is part of a sentence and will replace the subject if it appears in the first position.

**_Obwohl_ is a subordinating conjunction**. It will send the verb to the last position. See the lesson "Conjunctions" for more details.

### _Darum, deshalb, deswegen_

These three adverbs are synonymous. They can be used interchangeably.

The conjunctions _weil_ and _denn_ are used in the form "_Statement_, weil/denn _Reason_".

*   Ich bin müde, **weil** ich nicht geschlafen _habe_. (subordinating conjunction)
*   Ich bin müde, **denn** ich _habe_ nicht geschlafen. (coordinating conjunction)

_Darum_ and its sisters are used in the form "_Reason_, darum _Statement_" (or "_Statement_, darum _Result_").

*   Ich habe nicht geschlafen. **Darum** bin _ich_ müde.

### _Womit? Damit!_

Many prepositions can be combined with _wo-_ and _da-_. _Da_ roughly translates to "that" here, _wo_ normally to "what" (not "where" which is its normal meaning).


|wo-       |da-       |
|----------|----------|
|woran     |daran     |
|worauf    |darauf    |
|woraus    |daraus    |
|wobei     |dabei     |
|wodurch   |dadurch   |
|wofür     |dafür     |
|wogegen   |dagegen   |
|wohinter  |dahinter  |
|worin     |darin     |
|womit     |damit     |
|wonach    |danach    |
|worum     |darum     |
|worüber   |darüber   |
|worunter  |darunter  |
|wovon     |davon     |
|wovor     |davor     |
|wozu      |dazu      |
|wozwischen|dazwischen|


If the **preposition starts with a vowel**, there will be a **binding _r_**. So _worum_ is pronounced "wo-rum", not "wor-um".

#### Verbs: Preterite #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Preterite/practice) ^

### When is the _Präteritum_ used?

The _Präteritum_ (also called _Imperfekt_) is used to describe past events. Its use is mostly **limited to formal writing and formal speech**. In **informal writing and speech**, the **_Perfekt_ (e.g. _Ich habe geschlafen_) tends to be preferred**. Using the _Präteritum_ in normal conversation may sound unnatural or pretentious.

#### Verbs mostly used in _Präteritum_

The following verbs are normally not used in the _Perfekt_. Use _Präteritum_ instead.


|English|Verb  |Präteritum|
|-------|------|----------|
|to be  |sein  |ich war   |
|to have|haben |ich hatte |
|to know|wissen|ich wusste|
|may    |dürfen|ich durfte|
|can    |können|ich konnte|
|must   |müssen|ich musste|
|shall  |sollen|ich sollte|
|want to|wollen|ich wollte|


#### _Möchten_

The verb _möchten_ (would like to/to want to), which is technically the subjunctive of _mögen_, does not have a preterite form. Instead, the preterite of _wollen_ (to want \[to\]) is used.

### How is the _Präteritum_ formed?

#### Regular weak verbs

The _Präteritum_ of **regular weak verbs** is formed by adding _\-(e)te, -(e)test, -(e)ten,_ or _\-(e)tet_ to the stem.

_sagen_ (to say)


|Present                        |Präteritum                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|ich sage (I say)               |ich sagte (I said)              |
|du sagst (you say)             |du sagtest (you said)           |
|er/sie/es sagt (he/she/it says)|er/sie/es sagte (he/she/it said)|
|wir sagen (we say)             |wir sagten (we said)            |
|ihr sagt (you say)             |ihr sagtet (you said)           |
|sie/Sie sagen (they/you say)   |sie/Sie sagten (they/you said)  |


#### Irregular weak verbs

Some weak verbs, although generally regular, have a slightly irregular verb stem in the _Präteritum_. These are mostly modal verbs. Be sure **not to use the umlaut in the _Präteritum_** for these, as that will change it to the _Konjunktiv II_ (subjunctive) mood.

The endings will be the same as for other weak verbs.

*   ha**b**en - ich ha**t**te, du hattest, …
*   k**ö**nnen - ich k**o**nnte, du konntest, …
*   m**ü**ssen - ich m**u**sste, du musstest, …
*   d**ü**rfen - ich d**u**rfte, du durftest, …

#### Strong verbs

To form the _Präteritum_ of **strong verbs**, you need to **find the modified verb stem** first. Google "German irregular verbs" to get a list.

To this modified stem, you add the following endings:


|Person   |Ending|
|---------|------|
|ich      |-     |
|du       |-st   |
|er/sie/es|-     |
|wir      |-en   |
|ihr      |-t    |
|sie/Sie  |-en   |


Notice that these are the **same endings as for the modal verbs in the present tense**. **First and third person are the same** in singular and plural.

_finden_ (to find)


|Present                           |Präteritum                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|ich finde (I find)                |ich fand (I found)              |
|du findest (you find)             |du fandest (you found)          |
|er/sie/es findet (he/she/it finds)|er/sie/es fand (he/she/it found)|
|wir finden (we find)              |wir fanden (we found)           |
|ihr findet (you find)             |ihr fandet (you found)          |
|sie/Sie finden (they/you find)    |sie/Sie fanden (they/you found) |


_sein_ (to be)


|Present                     |Präteritum                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|ich bin (I am)              |ich war (I was)              |
|du bist (you are)           |du warst (you were)          |
|er/sie/es ist (he/she/it is)|er/sie/es war (he/she/it was)|
|wir sind (we are)           |wir waren (we were)          |
|ihr seid (you are)          |ihr wart (you were)          |
|sie/Sie sind (they/you are) |sie/Sie waren (they/you were)|


#### Adverbs B #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adverbs-B/practice) ^

### _Trotzdem_ vs. _obwohl_

_Obwohl_ translates to "although", while _trotzdem_ translates to "however/nevertheless".

*   Ich bin müde, **obwohl** ich Kaffee getrunken _habe_. (I'm tired, although I drank coffee.)
*   Ich habe Kaffee getrunken. **Trotzdem** bin _ich_ müde. (I drank coffee. Nevertheless, I'm tired.)

**_Trotzdem_ is an adverb**. It is part of a sentence and will replace the subject if it appears in the first position.

**_Obwohl_ is a subordinating conjunction**. It will send the verb to the last position. See the lesson "Conjunctions" for more details.

### _Darum, deshalb, deswegen_

These three adverbs are synonymous. They can be used interchangeably.

The conjunctions _weil_ and _denn_ are used in the form "_Statement_, weil/denn _Reason_".

*   Ich bin müde, **weil** ich nicht geschlafen _habe_. (subordinating conjunction)
*   Ich bin müde, **denn** ich _habe_ nicht geschlafen. (coordinating conjunction)

_Darum_ and its sisters are used in the form "_Reason_, darum _Statement_" (or "_Statement_, darum _Result_").

*   Ich habe nicht geschlafen. **Darum** bin _ich_ müde.

### _Womit? Damit!_

Many prepositions can be combined with _wo-_ and _da-_. _Da_ roughly translates to "that" here, _wo_ normally to "what" (not "where" which is its normal meaning).


|wo-       |da-       |
|----------|----------|
|woran     |daran     |
|worauf    |darauf    |
|woraus    |daraus    |

|wovon     |davon     |
|wovor     |davor     |
|wozu      |dazu      |
|wozwischen|dazwischen|


If the **preposition starts with a vowel**, there will be a **binding _r_**. So _worum_ is pronounced "wo-rum", not "wor-um".

#### Weather #3 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Weather/practice) ^

### _Gewitter_

_Das Gewitter_ refers to bad weather with lightning and thunder, not necessarily to strong winds. Hence, we do not accept the translation "storm" in this course.

#### Feelings #4 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Feelings/practice) ^

### Long and short vowels

#### Which sounds are there?

In German, every vowel can be long or short. The short one often sounds more open than the long one.

The IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is given for the geeks among you :) But you can also copy/paste one of these symbols into Wikipedia to get an in-depth explanation of it (with sound!).


|vowel|short |IPA|long  |IPA |
|-----|------|---|------|----|
|a    |Mann  |/a/|Bahn  |/aː/|
|ä    |Bälle |/ɛ/|Käse  |/ɛː/|
|e    |rennen|/ɛ/|Beere |/eː/|
|i    |Mitte |/ɪ/|ziehen|/iː/|
|o    |oft   |/ɔ/|ohne  |/oː/|
|ö    |Hölle |/œ/|schön |/øː/|
|u    |Mutter|/ʊ/|Buch  |/uː/|
|ü    |Müll  |/ʏ/|Bücher|/yː/|


You can also google "german sounds" for a longer introduction to German sounds.

#### When is a vowel short or long?

German has a range of spelling convention which will clearly show whether a vowel is short or long:

A vowel before a double consonant will be short:

*   Mann, denn, Mutter, Bälle, backen, Pizza, Katze

Note that instead of "zz" (which only occurs in the Italian "Pizza"), German uses _tz_. Instead of "kk", we use _ck_.

There are also some signals that clearly show the vowel is long.

Sometimes, the vowel will be doubled:

*   p_aa_r, B_ee_re, B_oo_t, … (this only happens with _a/e/o_)

There might be a silent _h_ behind the vowel:

*   f_ah_ren, z_äh_len, s_eh_en, _ih_r, _oh_ne, h_öh_er, _Uh_r, St_üh_le, …

Note that if you read the list above, you should not hear a single _h_ sound. It is _geh|en_, not _ge|hen_.

For _i_, it is more common to have an _\-e_ after it (sometimes even _\-eh_):

*   d_ie_, B_ie_ne, sp_ie_len, s_ie_ben, Bez_ieh_ung, …

Again, the _h_ will be silent: _Be|zieh|ung_, not _Be|zie|hung_.

But sometimes, there will not be a signal.

The following examples have an unmarked long vowel:

*   B_u_ch, d_a_, _A_bend, w_o_, Not, Zitr_o_ne, …

And here are some short ones:

*   _a_n, _O_nkel, _u_n-, M_a_m_a_, H_ä_lfte, Z_i_trone, …

For these, you just have to trust your language feeling, it will normally not be a big problem :)

#### Adjectives 2 #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives-2/practice) ^

### Adjective endings

When an adjective comes before a noun, its ending will change according to this noun.

*   Die Katze ist _alt_.
    
*   Das ist eine _alt**e**_ Katze.
    

#### Article + Adjective

You can think of the adjective endings as "markers", that kind of mark what part of speech the adjective belongs to.

##### Nominative

Remember that the nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. These are the **nominative adjectives**:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |der    |rote     |Hut   |
|      |ein    |roter    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


While that might look a bit chaotic, there is not so much going on:

1) **Masculine**: **Either the article, or the adjective** must have the _\-r_ ending. The same goes for **neuter and _\-s_**

*   De**r** klein**e** Hund spielt.
*   Ein klein**er** Hund spielt.

2) **Feminine and Plural end in _\-e_**. If you **add an article**, you also have to **add an _\-n_**.

*   Di**e** alt**e** Katze schläft.
*   Alt**e** Katzen schlafen.
*   Di**e** alt**en** Katzen schlafen.
*   Das sind **keine** alt**en** Katzen.

#### Communication 1 #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Communication-1/practice) ^

### Phones and cellphones

Believe it or not, people still use landline phones, especially in business contexts. A (tele)phone can be a cellphone or a landline phone. The word _(tele)phone_ is to the word _cellphone_ what the word _pet_ is to the word _dog_, i.e. generic vs. specific.

*   the tele(phone) = das Telefon
    
*   the cellphone (the mobile phone) = das Handy / das Mobiltelefon
    

Regardless of whether you always refer to your cellphone as a _phone_, in this course, you will not be able to use _(tele)phone/Telefon_ and _cellphone/Handy_ interchangeably.

### _Rufen, anrufen_

_Rufen_ translates to "call":

*   Ich rufe meinen Hund. (I call my dog.)

The word used for calling via phone is _**an**rufen_:

*   Ich _rufe_ meinen Bruder _an_. (I call my brother.)

Because people used to call the police long before phones existed, German uses _rufen_ for this:

*   Ich _ruf(e)_ die Polizei!!

### _Informationen_

Unlike English, the German word _die Information_ has a singular and a plural form.

### _Fernseher, Fernsehen_

_Der Fernsehe**r**_ refers to a TV set. _Das Fernsehe**n**_ refers to TV in general.

*   Ich habe gestern einen Fernsehe**r** gekauft. (I bought a TV yesterday.)
*   Ich bin im Fernsehe**n**! (I'm on TV!)

"Ich bin im Fernseher!" would mean "I'm inside the TV set!".

### _Fernsehen, frühstücken_

*   Ich sehe fern. Ich habe fern**ge**sehen.
*   Ich frühstücke. Ich habe **ge**frühstückt.

Why does one split, but not the other?

_Sehen_ is interpreted as a verb by itself. Thus, _fern_ is interpreted as the prefix. Because it is emphasized, it will split off. Because it splits off, the _\-ge-_ of the participle will end up inside the word.

_Stücken_ is not a verb. _Frühstücken_ is a verb that was created from the noun _das Frühstück_. Hence, the first syllable, although emphasized, will not split off.

#### Verbs Future 2 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Future-2/practice) ^

### _Werden_ + Infinitiv = Futur

German **normally uses the present tense to indicate the future**.

*   Ich _gehe_ morgen ins Kino. (I _will go_ to the movies tomorrow.)

On some occasions (for example when **making promises or predictions**), German _does_ use a **future tense**. It is very similar to the one in English.

The future tense consists of a **conjugated form of _werden_ in the present tense and an infinitive** (the base form of the verb).


|German                |English            |
|----------------------|-------------------|
|ich werde spielen     |I will play        |
|du wirst spielen      |you will play      |
|er/sie/es wird spielen|he/she/it will play|
|wir werden spielen    |we will play       |
|ihr werdet spielen    |you will play      |
|sie/Sie werden spielen|they/you will play |


Depending on the context, _ich werde spielen_ translates to "I will play" or "I am going to play". In German, there is no distinction between "will" and "going to".

Be aware that the German verb **_wollen_** (to want) **is a false friend of the English "will"**:

*   Ich _will_ spielen! (I _want to_ play!)

### _Werden_ has three different functions

Using _werden_ can be confusing for learners. However, there are **clear distinctions between its three main uses**:

#### _Werden_ + adjective/noun = "to become"

If _werden_ is used **in combination with an adjective or noun**, the meaning will be **"to become" or "to get"**:

*   Sie _wird_ Mutter. (She's becoming a mother.)
*   Ich _werde_ müde. (I'm getting tired.)

The German word _bekommen_ is a confusing false friend to "become":

*   Sie _bekommt_ eine Tochter. (She's getting a daughter.)

#### _Werden_ + Infinitiv = Futur

This case is explained above.

#### _Werden_ + past participle = passive

If used **in combination with a participle**, _werden_ creates one type of **passive**:

*   Der Taxifahrer fährt den Fahrgast. (The taxi driver drives the passenger.)
*   Der Fahrgast _wird_ _gefahren_. (The passenger is being driven.)

#### Internet & Social Media #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Internet-&-Social-Media/practice) ^

### _Die Seite_

_Die Seite_ can mean "the side" or "the page", depending on context.

*   Ich stehe auf der anderen Seite. (I am standing on the other side.)
*   Ich lese die Seite. (I read the page.)

In the context of the internet, it refers to a web page, as well as to a web site.

### _WLAN_

_WLAN_ is pronounced \[ˈveːlaːn\] in German. Unfortunately, the computer voice of the German course refuses to acknowledge this, and insists on pronouncing it wrong.

### _Drucken_ vs. _drücken_

_Dr**u**cken_ means "to print". The machine commonly used for that is _der Dr**u**cker_.

*   Ich muss noch zehn Seiten _drucken_! (I have to _print_ ten more pages!)

_Dr**ü**cken_ means "to press". _Der Drücker_ may refer to an electric button, or to a hug.

*   _Der Drücker_ am Aufzug ist kaputt. (_The button_ of the lift is broken.)
*   _Drücker_! (Hugs!)

#### Verbs: Past Perfect #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Past-Perfect/practice) ^

### Past perfect

#### When is the past perfect used?

The past perfect is used to describe past events, more specifically events that happened _way_ back in the past or any time before another event in the past.


|past perfect                |preterite      |
|----------------------------|---------------|
|Ich hatte ihn schon gesehen,|als er mich sah|
|I had already seen him      |when he saw me |


#### How is the past perfect formed?

The past perfect is formed almost the same way as the Perfekt. The only difference is that the helper verb will be in the past tense:

*   Ich _habe_ gegessen. (I have eaten.)
*   Ich _hatte_ gegessen. (I had eaten.)
    
*   Ich _bin_ geschwommen. (I have swum.)
    
*   Ich _war_ geschwommen. (I had swum.)

#### How to end up with the right participle?

Refer to the "Perfect" lesson in order to review how to form the perfect participle that goes with it.

#### Verbs: Future Perfect #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Future-Perfect/practice) ^

### Future Perfect

The future perfect talks about actions that will have been completed in the future. It's used pretty much like the English future perfect, but it's formed slightly differently.

The future perfect consists of the future tense of the auxiliary verb _haben_ or _sein,_ and the past participle of the main verb.

#### _Haben_ vs. _sein_

The vast majority of verbs take _haben_. Verbs that take _sein_ have to be intransitive, i.e. they can't take an object, and they have to indicate a change of position or condition. _sein_ (to be), _bleiben_ (to stay), and _passieren_ (to happen) take _sein_ even though they don't indicate a change of position or condition.

Please refer to the "Perfect" lesson to review how to form the participle, and for more details on when to use _haben_ or _sein_.

#### Future Perfect with _haben_

_essen_ (to eat):

The auxiliary verb that goes with _essen_ is _haben_. All you need to do is form the future tense of _haben_ _(ich werde haben)_ and add the past participle of the main verb _essen_ _(gegessen)_ to the left of _haben._


|German                       |English                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
|ich werde gegessen haben     |I will have eaten        |
|du wirst gegessen haben      |you will have eaten      |
|er/sie/es wird gegessen haben|he/she/it will have eaten|
|wir werden gegessen haben    |we will have eaten       |
|ihr werdet gegessen haben    |you will have eaten      |
|sie werden gegessen haben    |they will have eaten     |
|Sie werden gegessen haben    |you will have eaten      |


#### Future Perfect with _sein_

_gehen_ (to leave/to go):

The auxiliary verb that goes with _gehen_ is _sein_. All you need to do is form the future tense of _sein_ _(ich werde sein)_ and add the past participle of the main verb _gehen_ _(gegangen)_ to the left of _sein._


|German                      |English                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
|ich werde gegangen sein     |I will have left        |
|du wirst gegangen sein      |you will have left      |
|er/sie/es wird gegangen sein|he/she/it will have left|
|wir werden gegangen sein    |we will have left       |
|ihr werdet gegangen sein    |you will have left      |
|sie werden gegangen sein    |they will have left     |
|Sie werden gegangen sein    |you will have left      |


#### People 2 #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/People-2/practice) ^

### _Verein_

_Der Verein_ (the _r_ is silent) is something between a club and a society. It is very common in Germany: There are almost 600,000 _eingetragene Vereine_ (publicly registered associations) in Germany. They bear the abbreviation _e.V._.

A _Verein_ might help the homeless, offer tennis lessons, dance together, among many other activities.

### _Man_

In English, you can say "you can say" or "one can say". In German, _man_ is commonly used for this purpose. It does not imply that only male people are included, think of it like the English "man" as in "mankind".

Grammatically, it works exactly like _er_:

*   _Er_ schläft nicht auf der Küche. (He does not sleep in the kitchen)
*   _Man_ schläft nicht in der Küche! (One does not sleep in the kitchen!)

#### _Ein paar_ vs. _ein Paar_

_Ein paar_ (lowercase p) means _a few_, _some_ or _a couple (of)_ (only in the sense of **at least two, not exactly two!**).

_Ein Paar_ (uppercase P) means _a pair (of)_ and is only used for things that typically come in pairs of two, e.g. _ein Paar Schuhe_ (a pair of shoes).

So this is quite similar to English "a couple" (a pair) vs. "a couple of" (some).

#### Common Phrases 2 #2 · 2019-02-20[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Common-Phrases-2/practice) ^

### _Naja_, _na und_, _na sowas_

_Na_ appears in some short interjections or phrases:


|        |Example                                           |English   |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
|naja    |"Was ist das Problem?" — "Naja, dein Hund stinkt."|Well…     |
|na und  |"Dein Hund stinkt." — "Na und?"                   |so what?  |
|na klar |"Stinkt dein Hund?" — "Na klar!"                  |of course!|
|na sowas|"Dein Hund tanzt" — "Na sowas!"                   |Oh wow!   |


#### Verbs Reflexive #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Reflexive/practice) ^

### Reflexive verbs

Reflexive verbs are pretty common in many European languages, but in comparison are rather rare in English:

*   He hurt him_self_.
*   She found her_self_.

In German, they are more frequent. Sometimes, they make perfect sense:

*   Ich wasche _mich_. ("I wash myself", as opposed to my dog)

But often, the reason for using this form is lost in history, and the verb just has to be learned as is:

*   Ich befinde _mich_ im Garten. ("I'm in the garden", literally "I find myself in the garden")
*   Sie setzt _sich_ hin. ("She sits down", lit. "She seats herself")
*   Ich erinnere _mich_ nicht. ("I don't remember" (myself))

#### Verb objects

Remember that verbs often have a "direct object". This will be in the accusative case:

*   Der Mann isst _einen Apfel_.

Some verbs have an additional "indirect object", which will be in the dative case:

*   Der Mann gibt _dem Kind_ _einen Apfel_. (The man gives an apple to the child.)

The reflexive pronoun will take the place of one of these objects.

#### Replacing the "lost" object

Because the **reflexive part takes up the object**, **some reflexive verbs need a preposition** to go with them. This preposition has to be learned together with the verb.

*   sich interessieren _für_ (to have an interest in)
*   sich freuen _auf_ (to look forward to)
*   sich freuen _über_ (to be happy about)
*   sich kümmern _um_ (to care for)
*   sich treffen _mit_ (to meet with)

#### Accusative reflexive verbs

In most reflexive verbs, the direct object gets replaced by the reflexive pronoun. Thus, use the accusative versions.

*   Ich rasiere _mich_. ("I shave", literally "I shave myself")

#### Dative reflexive verbs

If the **verb already has a direct (accusative) object**, the **reflexive pronoun will be in the dative case**:

First, consider this example (_mich_ is in the accusative):

*   Ich wasche _mich_. (I wash, literally "I wash myself")

In the next example, "die Haare" is the Accusative object. Hence, the reflexive pronoun is in the dative ("mir"):

*   Ich wasche _mir_ die Haare. ("I wash my hair", literally "I wash the hairs to myself")

Here are some verbs with dative reflexive pronouns:

*   Ich wünsche _mir_ einen Hund. (I wish for a dog.)
*   Ich sehe _mir_ den Film an. (I watch the movie.)
*   Ich habe _mir_ das Bein gebrochen. (I broke my leg.)

#### Reflexive pronouns

Here is a review of the **normal pronouns**:


|nom.     |acc.      |dat.       |
|---------|----------|-----------|
|ich      |mich      |mir        |
|du       |dich      |dir        |
|er/sie/es|ihn/sie/es|ihm/ihr/ihm|
|wir      |uns       |uns        |
|ihr      |euch      |euch       |
|sie/Sie  |sie/Sie   |ihnen/Ihnen|


Notice that for **_wir_ and _ihr_, accusative and dative do not differ**.

Here are the **accusative and dative reflexive pronouns**:


|nom.     |acc. refl.|dat. refl.|
|---------|----------|----------|
|ich      |mich      |mir       |
|du       |dich      |dir       |
|er/sie/es|sich      |sich      |
|wir      |uns       |uns       |
|ihr      |euch      |euch      |
|sie/Sie  |sich      |sich      |


The **reflexive pronoun for the third person (singular and plural) is _sich_**. Otherwise, they don't differ from their non-reflexive counterparts.

This means that if you see a sentence such as:

*   Er wäscht _ihm_ die Füße.

It must be a different person: He washes the feet of somebody else. If it were his own feet, the sentence would be:

*   Er wäscht _sich_ die Füße.

#### Communication 2 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Communication-2/practice) ^

### _Post_

_Die Post_ has several meanings in German.

It can refer to the mail in your mailbox:

*   Ist _die Post_ schon da? (Has the mail arrived yet?)

It can also refer to the post office:

*   Gehst du heute _zur Post_? (Are you going to the post office today?)

Or, it can refer to the mail company (which used to be state run in Germany):

*   _Die Post_ hat die Gebühren erhöht. (The mail company raised their fees.)

#### Business 1 #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Business-1/practice) ^

### _Fabrik_

Don't confuse _die Fabrik_ (the manufacturing plant) with the English word "fabric". The former is the place where something is fabricated, the latter is the fabricated product of the world's first manufacturing plants (hence the name).

In addition, _die Fabrik_ is stressed on the last syllable.

#### Language #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Language/practice) ^

### _Geschichte_

In German, the words for "story" and "history" are the same (just as in Spanish).

However, they are used differently. When used with an article, it generally refers to a story:

*   Hast du _die Geschichte_ gelesen? (Did you read the story?)

Most of the time, when referring to history, there won't be an article:

*   Ich habe _Geschichte_ studiert. (I studied history at university.)

In addition, only "story" will have a plural version:

*   Er erzählt lustige _Geschichten_. (He tells funny stories.)

#### Money #7 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Money/practice) ^

#### _Euro_ or _Euros_?

In German, the singular is _Euro_ and the **plural is usually _Euro_** as well. As a rule of thumb, use _Euro_ when talking about a specific amount, e.g. _200 Euro_.

In some contexts, the form _Euros_ is used as well. For instance, you can say _Euros_ to refer to individual euro coins, an unquantified amount of euros, or euros as opposed to a different currency, e.g.:

*   Ich habe hundert Schweizer Franken, aber keine _Euros_ (I have a hundred Swiss francs but no euros).

Many native speakers use either plural form regardless of context.

In English, either plural form is perfectly fine. The plural form _euro_ tends to be preferred in the Republic of Ireland, and the plural form _euros_ tends to preferred pretty much anywhere else. Originally, the plural form _euro_ was supposed to be used in official EU documents, but that's no longer the case.

#### Abstract Objects 1 #1 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Abstract-Objects-1/practice) ^

### _Drucken_ vs. _drücken_

_Dr**u**cken_ means "to print". The machine commonly used for that is _der Dr**u**cker_.

*   Ich muss noch zehn Seiten _drucken_! (I have to print ten more pages!)
    
*   _Der Drucker_ ist kaputt! (The printer is broken!)
    

_Dr**ü**cken_ means "to press". _Der Dr**ü**cker_ may refer to an electric button, or to a hug.

*   _Der Drücker_ am Aufzug ist kaputt. (The button of the lift is broken.)
*   _Drücker_! (Hugs!)

Slightly confusingly, _der Druck_ can refer to "pressure", but also to a "print".

*   Mach keinen _Druck_! (Don't create stress!)
*   _Der Druck_ ist schön. (The print is nice.)

#### Friends #5 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Friends/practice) ^

### The third case.

German has four cases. You already learned two so far, nominative and accusative.

Nominative is used for sentence subjects.

Accusative is mostly used for sentence objects. Some prepositions will use accusative, too.

The third important case is "dative".

### Dative pronouns

Here are the first three dative pronouns for you, together with the nominative and accusative counterparts:


|Nom.      |Akk.|Dat.|
|----------|----|----|
|ich       |mich|mir |
|du        |dich|dir |
|sie (fem.)|sie |ihr |


#### What is dative for?

As the accusative, the dative case has several functions.

Some **prepositions** go with dative:

*   mit, zu, aus, von, bei
    
*   Komm _mit mir_! (Come _with me_!)
    
*   Ich gehe _zu ihr_. (I go _to her_.)

For most verbs, the object is in the accusative case:

*   Ich sehe _dich_. (I see _you_.)

A few **verbs use the dative** instead:

*   Ich helfe _dir_. (I help _you_.)
*   Ich danke _dir_. (I thank _you_.)

Some **verbs have two objects**. The one identifying the "other person involved in a transaction" will also be in dative:

*   Ich habe einen Hund. (I have a dog.)
*   Ich gebe _dir_ einen Hund. (I give _you_ a dog.)

These three cases will appear in most sentences, so take your time to get a feeling for them.

There is a fourth case (genitive), but it is not used a lot.

### Telling the time

Germans mostly use a system similar to English. There is one important and confusing difference: While English uses "half past seven", German will say "half eight".


|Time |                 |
|-----|-----------------|
|10:00|zehn (Uhr)       |
|10:05|fünf nach zehn   |
|10:15|viertel nach zehn|
|10:30|halb elf         |
|10:45|viertel vor elf  |
|10:55|fünf vor elf     |


In addition, the 25 and 35 minutes will refer to the half hour:


|Time |                  |
|-----|------------------|
|10:25|fünf vor halb elf |
|10:35|fünf nach halb elf|


This colloquial system only uses hours from one to twelve.

German official time uses hours from zero to 24:


|Time |                          |
|-----|--------------------------|
|10:12|zehn Uhr zwölf            |
|22:50|zweiundzwanzig Uhr fünfzig|


### _Komm!_

Similar to English, the imperative omits the pronoun. You will learn more about this later. For now, just remember that to say "Come (on)!", German uses _Komm!_ (not _kommst_, as you might have suspected).

#### Animals 2 #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Animals-2/practice) ^

### _Affen_

In German, _der Affe_ may refer to all primates, or to all primates excluding lemurs.

In everyday English, "apes" tend to be distinguished from other primates, most of which are referred to as "monkeys". German does not make this distinction. If you want to refer to apes only, you can use the word _Menschenaffen_.

### _Kamele_

_Das Kamel_ is stressed on the last syllable: \[kaˈmeːl\]. Unfortunately, Duolingo's computer voice has other ideas about this. When you're in Cologne, don't confuse these adorable, but weighty animals with _Kamelle_ (\[kaˈmɛlə\], caramels traditionally thrown around during _Karneval_).

#### Verbs: Present 3 #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Present-3/practice) ^

### _Telefonieren, anrufen_

_Telefonieren_ does not have an object (it is "intransitive"). Hence, you need a preposition for the other person:

*   Ich _telefoniere mit_ meiner Mutter. (I'm on the phone with my mother.)

On the other hand, _anrufen_ has an accusative object:

*   Ich _rufe_ meine Mutter _an_. (I _call_ my mother.)

Remember that for the police, you would use _rufen_ (without the _an-_):

*   _Ruf_ die Polizei! (_Call_ the police!)

### _Wechseln, tauschen_

_Tauschen_ generally means to swap, or to change something:

*   Komm, wir _tauschen_ unsere Hüte! (Come, we swap our hats!)

_Austauschen_ or _(aus)wechseln_ mean to exchange/substitute:

*   Er _tauscht_ die Batterien _aus_. (He _exchanges_ the batteries.)
*   Er _wechselt_ die Batterien _(aus)_.

_Wechseln_ by itself can also mean "to switch/change":

*   Er _wechselt_ den Fußballverein. (He _switches_ the soccer club.)
*   Er _wechselt_ die Socken. (He _changes_ his socks.)

This is also the word used for changing money:

*   Ich muss noch Geld _wechseln_. (I have to _change_ money first.)

#### Verbs Future 3 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Future-3/practice) ^

### _Drucken_ vs. _drücken_

_Dr**u**cken_ means "to print". The machine commonly used for that is _der Dr**u**cker_.

*   Ich muss noch zehn Seiten _drucken_! (I have to print ten more pages!)
    
*   _Der Drucker_ ist kaputt! (The printer is broken!)
    

_Dr**ü**cken_ means "to press". _Der Dr**ü**cker_ may refer to an electric button, or to a hug.

*   _Der Drücker_ am Aufzug ist kaputt. (The button of the lift is broken.)
*   _Drücker_! (Hugs!)

Slightly confusingly, _der Druck_ can refer to "pressure", but also to a "print".

*   Mach keinen _Druck_! (Don't create stress!)
*   _Der Druck_ ist schön. (The print is nice.)

#### Verbs: Conditional #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Conditional/practice) ^

### Conditional mood

The conditional mood is mostly used for wishes or unreal situations.

*   I wish I _had_ a parrot!
*   If I _were_ you, I _would_ sleep more.

#### Use _würde_ for most verbs

Where English uses _would_, German uses forms of _würde_:


|German                 |English             |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
|ich würde spielen      |I would play        |
|du würdest spielen     |you would play      |
|er/sie/es würde spielen|he/she/it would play|
|wir würden spielen     |we would play       |
|ihr würdet spielen     |you would play      |
|sie/Sie würden spielen |they/you would play |


#### Some verbs have their own forms

Sometimes, English uses special forms for the Conditional. These generally look like Simple Past forms:

*   Yesterday, I _had_ a dream.
*   I wish I _had_ a dream.

In German, these two forms are also similar. However, German normally **adds an umlaut change (and occasional _\-e_)**:


|person   |Präteritum|Conditional|
|---------|----------|-----------|
|ich      |war       |wäre       |
|du       |warst     |wär(e)st   |
|er/sie/es|war       |wäre       |
|wir      |waren     |wären      |
|ihr      |wart      |wär(e)t    |
|sie/Sie  |waren     |wären      |


Apart from the _sein_, _haben_ and the modal verbs, only a few verbs are still conjugated directly. For most verbs, this is now unusual, and considered old-fashioned. Use _würde_ + infinitive instead.

To show you the pattern, here are the forms for _haben_ (to have), _dürfen_ (may) and _geben_ (to give):


|person           |haben  |dürfen  |geben|
|-----------------|-------|--------|-----|
|(Präteritum: ich)|(hatte)|(durfte)|(gab)|
|ich              |hätte  |dürfte  |gäbe |
|du               |hättest|dürftest|gäbst|
|er/sie/es        |hätte  |dürfte  |gäbe |
|wir              |hätten |dürften |gäben|
|ihr              |hättet |dürftet |gäbt |
|sie/Sie          |hätten |dürften |gäben|


For the other modal verbs, the forms for _ich_ are:

*   müssen - müsste
*   wollen - wollte (no umlaut change!)
*   sollen - sollte (also no umlaut change)

Here are some other verbs that use their own form for the Conditional:

*   gehen (to go) - ginge
*   wissen (to know) - wüsste
*   wünschen (to wish) - wünschte
*   tun (to do) - täte
*   brauchen (to need) - bräuchte

Again, for most other verbs, use _würde_ + infinitive.

#### Math #5 · 2018-10-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Math/practice) ^

### Equals

There are several ways to talk about equations:

*   Vier plus drei _macht_ sieben.
*   Zwei plus zwei _ist_ vier.
*   Eins plus fünf _(ist) gleich_ sechs.
*   Sieben plus acht _ergibt_ fünfzehn.

These are all equivalent (ha!).

#### Abstract Objects 2 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Abstract-Objects-2/practice) ^

### _Party, Partei_

_Die Party_, an English loanword, refers to a celebration.

A political party will be _die Partei_.

#### Colors #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Colors/practice) ^

### Adjective endings

When an adjective comes before a noun, its ending will change according to this noun.

*   Die Katze ist _alt_.
    
*   Das ist _eine alt**e** Katze_.
    

#### Article + Adjective

You can think of the adjective endings as "markers", that kind of mark what part of speech the adjective belongs to.

##### Nominative

Remember that Nominative is used for the subject of a sentence. These are the **nominative adjectives**:


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |der    |rote     |Hut   |
|      |ein    |roter    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


While that might look a bit chaotic, there is not so much going on:

1) **Masculine**: **Either the article, or the adjective** must have the _\-r_ ending. The same goes for **neuter and _\-s_**.

*   _De**r** klein**e**_ Hund spielt.
*   _Ein klein**er** Hund_ spielt.

2) **Feminine and Plural end in _\-e_**. If you **add an article**, you also have to **add an _\-n_**.

*   _**Die** alt**e** Katze_ schläft.
*   _Alt**e** Katzen_ schlafen.
*   _**Die** alt**en** Katzen_ schlafen.
*   Das sind _**keine** alt**en** Katzen_.

##### Accusative

Do you remember that quite often, the accusative looks like the nominative? Specifically, only the articles for masculine nouns change.

The same goes for the adjectives. The accusative endings are the same as for Nominative; the only exception is for masculine nouns. The changes are marked in bold in the table below.

3) **Masculine accusative: adjective ends in _\-en_**

*   _Die alte Katze_ schläft. _De**r** alt**e**_ Mann sieht _die alte Katze_ (no change)
*   Die alte Katze sieht _de**n** alt**en** Mann_.


|gender|article|adjective|noun  |
|------|-------|---------|------|
|masc. |den    |roten    |Hut   |
|      |einen  |roten    |Hut   |
|neut. |das    |rote     |Hemd  |
|      |ein    |rotes    |Hemd  |
|fem.  |die    |rote     |Rose  |
|      |eine   |rote     |Rose  |
|Plural|die    |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |keine  |roten    |Schuhe|
|      |-      |rote     |Schuhe|


##### Dative

Dative, as always, is even simpler.

4) **Dative**: **all adjectives get an _\-en_ ending**

*   Der Hund _mit der roten Nase_ schläft. (The dog _with the red nose_ is sleeping.)


|gender|article|adjective|noun   |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
|masc. |dem    |roten    |Hut    |
|      |einem  |roten    |Hut    |
|neut. |dem    |roten    |Hemd   |
|      |einem  |roten    |Hemd   |
|fem.  |der    |roten    |Rose   |
|      |einer  |roten    |Rose   |
|Plural|den    |roten    |Schuhen|
|      |keinen |roten    |Schuhen|
|      |-      |roten    |Schuhen|


Remember that in dative,

*   masculine/neuter articles end in _\-m_
*   feminine articles end in _\-r_
*   plural articles end in _\-n_
*   and plural nouns (almost) always end in _\-n_.

#### Verbs: Conditional Perfect #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Conditional-Perfect/practice) ^

### Conditional Perfect

Conditional Perfect works just as normal Perfect, but **uses the conditional form of _haben_** instead. So,

*   Ich _habe_ ihn gesehen.

becomes

*   Ich _hätte_ ihn gesehen.

For verbs that use _sein_ instead, use the **conditional form of _sein_**:

*   Ich _bin_ Auto gefahren.

becomes

*   Ich _wäre_ Auto gefahren.

Be aware that in some verbs, such as _behalten, verlassen, erfahren_, the Participle looks like the Infinitive. Don't let that confuse you, always use the Participle!

#### Occupation #5 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Occupation/practice) ^

### _Student_ or _Schüler_?

A _Student_ is a university student and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### Dropping articles

When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as _I'm a teacher_ or _She's a judge_, German speakers **usually drop the indefinite article** _(ein/eine)_. It sounds more natural to say _Ich bin Lehrer_ and _Sie ist Richterin_ than _Ich bin ein Lehrer_ and _Sie ist eine Richterin_. This rule also applies to students.

If you add an adjective, you can't drop the article. _Er ist ein schlechter Arzt_ (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but _Er ist schlechter Arzt_ is not.

Also note that **you can't drop the definite article** _(der/die/das)_.

### Male and female variants

The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to, i.e. the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically feminine. In the vast majority of cases, **the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix _\-in_ to the male variant**, e.g. _der Bäcker_ becomes _die Bäckerin_ and _der Schüler_ (the pupil) becomes _die Schülerin_.

**The plural __of the female variant__ is formed by adding the suffix _\-innen_** to the singular of the male variant, e.g. _die Bäcker**innen**_ and _die Schüler**innen**_.

Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female variant as well, e.g. _der K**o**ch_ becomes _die K**ö**che_ and _die K**ö**chin_ becomes _die K**ö**chinnen_.

#### Verbs Future 4 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs-Future-4/practice) ^

### The power of _machen_

_Machen_ (to do) is a very versatile word. Often, when you don't know the word for an action, you can somehow use _machen_ do describe it. Often, there is even an existing word combination:

Here are some examples. The "higher-level" word is in brackets.

*   _auf_machen (öffnen) — to open
*   _zu_machen (schließen) — to close
*   _besser_ machen (verbessern) — to improve
*   _weg_machen (entfernen) — to remove

As a fallback, it can help you to just continue speaking, even when you run the risk making up your own words:

*   Ich muss den Brief noch _machen_. (very bad German, but people will get what you mean)

As a **general rule**: It's better to speak bad German, than to stop speaking, just because you don't know how to say it well. Keep going, and learn from your mistakes.

Fake it, till you make it :)

#### Materials #7 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Materials/practice) ^

#### _Plastik_

_Plastik_ is one of the few words that changes meaning, depending on which gender it is.

*   das Plastik (artificial material, normally from petroleum)
*   die Plastik (a word for "sculpture")

#### _Holz, Wald, Forst_

In English, "wood" can refer to a material, and to a forest.

In German, _Holz_ only refers to the material. _Der Wald_ is "the forest". We also have a word _der Forst_, but it only refers to a maintained forest (something like a garden for trees), where the trees are grown for commercial purposes.

#### Adjectives 3 #2 · 2019-04-18[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adjectives-3/practice) ^

### Common adjective endings

#### _\-ig_, _\-lich_, _\-isch_

Here are three common endings, which sound very similar:

*   _\-ig_ (roughly like _\-y_ in English): eindeutig, abhängig, …
*   _\-lich_ (roughly _\-ly_ in English): nützlich, möglich, persönlich, …
*   _\-isch_ (roughly _\-ic(al)_ in English): praktisch, logisch, …

The first two sound the same in regular speech (in some dialects, all three sound the same). You already encountered this with the numbers (zwanz_ig_).

When you add an ending to the _\-ig_ adjectives, it will no longer sound like _ch_:

*   eindeuti_g_: die eindeuti_ge_ … (now sounds like _g_)
*   mögli_ch_: der mögli_che_ … (still sounds like _ch_)

#### _\-bar_

_\-bar_ often corresponds to "-(a)ble" in English:

*   sicht_bar_ (visi_ble_)
*   verfüg_bar_ (avail_able_)

Yes, there are lots of bars with joke adjective names in Germany :)

#### _\-los_, _\-voll_

These correspond to English "-less" and "-ful".

*   hoffnungs_voll_ (hope_ful_)
*   hoffnungs_los_ (hope_less_)

### _\-tion_

In English, the "-tion" ending is pronounced "-shen". In German, it always becomes "-tsion". It will always be the emphasized syllable, and the word will always be feminine.

*   Kommunika_tion_, Lek_tion_, Na_tion_

Similarly, _der Patient_ will sound like "der Patsient".

When nouns ending in _\-tion_ are used in an adjective, the ending _\-al_ (or _\-ell_) will be used. The resulting adjective will be pronounced on the last syllable:

*   internation_al_, ration_al_, kommun_al_, sensation_ell_, …

#### University #2 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/University/practice) ^

### Comparative

The comparative for short words in English is commonly formed by adding _\-er_ to the adjective:

*   fast, faster
*   smart, smarter

German works in the same way. Of course, you then have to add the correct adjective ending to the whole thing:

*   schnell, schneller
*   ein schneller Mann, ein schneller_er_ Hund, eine schneller_e_ Katze (a fast man, a faster dog, a faster cat)

For longer adjectives, English uses "more" instead. German does not do that.

*   interesting, more interesting
*   interessant, interessant_er_

Short adjectives usually get an umlaut change, though:

*   alt, _ä_lter
*   groß, gr_ö_ßer

Remember that _gern_ is an adverb. German uses it to describe things it likes. It has the comparative _lieber_:

*   Ich esse _gern_ Pizza. Ich esse _lieber_ Lasagne.
*   I like to eat pizza. I prefer to eat lasagna.

### _Seit_

In English, you can say:

*   I have been learning German for two months.

In German, you would instead say:

*   Ich lerne seit zwei Monaten Deutsch.

First, as it is still ongoing, the present tense is used.

Second, German uses _seit_ for stretches of time that reach into the present. That means you can only use it for things that are still ongoing.

If _seit_ is combined with a noun, it takes the dative. Remember that in dative plural, the noun gets an extra _\-n_:

*   der Monat, die Monate > seit zwei Monate_n_

### _Anfang, Mitte, Ende_

In English, "early, mid, late" refers to positions in a day, month, or year:

*   in _late_ May

In German, _Anfang, Mitte, Ende_ can be used like this:

*   _Ende_ Mai

These can also be used for age:

*   Sie ist _Anfang zwanzig_. (She is in her early twenties.)

#### Qualifiers #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Qualifiers/practice) ^

### Superlative

Please refer to the lesson "Comparisons" for a table of comparative and superlative forms, especially how to form the irregular forms.

#### Superlative as an adverb

In the last lesson, you learned the comparative:

*   Der Hund ist _alt_. Die Katze ist _älter_.

As in English, there is also a superlative:

*   Der Papagei ist **am ältesten**. (The parrot is the oldest.)
    
*   Sie rennt **am schnellsten**. (She runs the fastest.)
    

_Am ältesten_ works like an adverb (How _is_ he? - the oldest; How does she run? the fastest). That means its endings will never change.

#### Superlative as an adjective

Like in English, you can also use superlatives as adjectives.

Remember that adjectives change their endings according to the noun, if they come before the noun:

*   Er ist _der älteste_ Hund. (He is the oldest dog.)
*   Wir haben _den ältesten_ Hund.

Now, consider these two sentences:

*   Mein Hund ist _der älteste_. (imagine a second "Hund" at the end)
*   Mein Hund ist _am ältesten_.

Both translate to "My dog is _the oldest_", and both are possible in German. The last one is more common though, and we recommend you only use this one for now.

On the other hand, **you cannot say**:

*   Er der _am ältesten_ Hund. (**This is wrong!!**)

This is because you can't put an adverb in front of a noun. That's what adjectives are for.

Don't forget that with adjectives, you have to use the right ending to match with the noun:

*   Das ist _die kleinste_ Katze der Welt! (This is the world's _smallest_ cat!)
*   Wir geben _der schönsten_ Katze einen Preis. (We give a prize to the _most beautiful_ cat.)

As a rough guideline, use a form like _die älteste, den ältesten, …_ before a noun, and _am ältesten_ at the end of a sentence.

### _Ganz_

#### As an adjective: easy

The word "ganz" has several functions in German. As an adjective, it means "whole":

*   Ich esse den ganzen Apfel. (I eat the whole apple.)

#### As an adverb: tricky!

As as adverb, it can **intensify _or_ de-intensify** other words (depending on which other word you use).

Consider "very fast" vs. "quite fast" in English. "Very" is an intensifier, "quite" is a de-intensifier.

Here's a table to get an idea of the problem:


|Intensifies|De-Intensifies|
|-----------|--------------|
|schlecht   |gut           |
|oben       |nett          |
|vorne      |sympathisch   |
|früh       |schön         |
|sicher     |interessant   |
|toll       |gern          |
|furchtbar  |lustig        |
|…          |ok            |


Consider these examples:

*   Der Film war _ganz gut_. (The film was quite nice.)
*   Der Film war _ganz toll_! (The film was really great!)

You see the problem :) _Ganz_ is tricky to use for beginners. For now, better **use these two words instead**:

*   _ziemlich_ (always means "quite")
*   _total_ (always means "really")
    
*   Der Film war _total_ gut. (The film was really nice.)
    
*   Der Film war _ziemlich_ toll. (The film was quite great.)

#### Arts #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Arts/practice) ^

### _Plastik_

_Plastik_ is one of the few words that changes meaning, depending on which gender it is.

*   das Plastik (artificial material, normally from petroleum)
*   die Plastik (a word for "sculpture")

#### Places 2 #2 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Places-2/practice) ^

### Bundesland

Germany is a Federal Republic (Bundesrepublik). It consists of 16 federal states, which have some degree of autonomy. These are called _Bundesländer_.

### Pension

_Die Pension_ has different meanings, depending on context. Here it means "guest house". It can also mean "retirement pay".

#### Passive Voice #7 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Passive-Voice/practice) ^

### Passive with _werden_

In German, _werden_ + _perfect participle_ forms a passive:

*   Ich schreibe einen Brief. (I write a letter.)
*   Ein Brief _wird_ geschrieben. (A letter is being written.)

Note that the accusative object of an active sentence (_einen Brief_) becomes the (nominative) subject of the passive version (_ein Brief_).

The passive is often used when the original subject is unknown or irrelevant:

*   Mein Handy _wurde_ gestohlen! ("My phone was stolen!" — You don't know who did it.)
*   Mein Handy _wurde_ repariert. ("My phone was fixed." — You don't care by whom.)

### _Werden_ has three different functions

Using _werden_ can be confusing for learners. However, there are **clear distinctions between its three main uses**:

#### _Werden_ + adjective/noun = "to become"

If _werden_ is used **in combination with an adjective or noun**, the meaning will be **"to become" or "to get"**:

*   Sie _wird_ Mutter. (She's becoming a mother.)
*   Ich _werde_ müde. (I'm getting tired.)

The German word _bekommen_ is a confusing false friend to "become":

*   Sie _bekommt_ eine Tochter. (She's getting a daughter.)

#### _Werden_ + Infinitiv = Futur

Refer to the lesson "Future 2" for details.

#### _Werden_ + past participle = passive

If used **in combination with a participle**, _werden_ creates one type of **passive**:

*   Der Taxifahrer fährt den Fahrgast. (The taxi driver drives the passenger.)
*   Der Fahrgast wird _gefahren_. (The passenger is being driven.)

|Monday           |Montag (moon)            |
|Tuesday          |Dienstag (god "Tyr"?)    |

|Saturday (Saturn)|Samstag (sabbath)        |


However, we changed to Monday as the start of the week, which makes _Mittwoch_ sound a bit silly now :)

#### Am, im, um

If you want to say "on Monday" and so on, that would be _am Montag_.

Here's a mnemonic to remember when to use which:

*   **a**m Mont**a**g
*   **u**m drei **U**hr
*   **i**m Jun**i**

#### Grammar 3 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Grammar/practice) ^

### Prepositions

#### Accusative prepositions

Accusative prepositions **always** trigger the accusative case.

Here are the most common ones: **durch, für, gegen, ohne, um**

#### Dative prepositions

Dative prepositions **always** trigger the dative case.

Here are the most common ones: **aus, außer, bei, gegenüber, mit, nach, seit, von, zu**

#### Two-way prepositions

**Two-way prepositions** take the **dative case or the accusative case**, depending on the context.

This is an unusual, but central part of German grammar.

If there's **movement from one place to another**, use the **accusative** case.

*   Die Katze geht _in die Küche_. (The cat walks into the kitchen.)

If there's **no movement**, or if there's **movement within a certain place**, use the **dative** case.

*   Die Katze schläft _in der Küche_. (The cat sleeps in the kitchen.)
*   Die Katze geht _in der Küche_. (The cat walks within the kitchen.)

These prepositions can switch case: **an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen**

#### When _not_ to think about location change

Two-way prepositions are very common in everyday speech, so it's a good idea to practice them to fluency.

However, don't forget that **for some prepositions, you don't have to decide**:

_Durch_ and _um_ will always be accusative, although they might signify an activity without location change:

*   Das Kind rennt _durch den_ Wald. (The child is running through the forest.)
*   Die Stühle stehen _um den_ Tisch. (The chairs are standing around the table.)

_Aus_, _von_, _zu_ will always be dative, although they might signify a location change.

*   Er kommt _aus der_ Küche (He comes out of the kitchen.)
*   Ich fahre _zur_ Arbeit. (I go to work.)
*   Ich komme _von der_ Arbeit. (I come from work.)

#### Other uses for two-way prepositions

Some verbs use one of these prepositions in a way that is _not about location_. This is part of language change, where things get repurposed all the time.

_Über_ will always trigger the accusative case:

*   Sie diskutieren _über den_ Krieg. (They discuss the war.)

When used with these verbs, _vor_ will always trigger the Dative:

*   Er warnt _vor dem_ Hund. (He warns about the dog.)

_An_, _in_ and _auf_ are more complicated: in some verbs, they trigger the accusative, in others the dative. You'll just have to memorize these.

*   Er _denkt_ _an seinen_ Bruder. (He thinks of his brother.)
*   Er _arbeitet_ _an einem_ Film (He's working on a film.)
    
*   Ich _warte_ _auf den_ Bus. (I'm waiting for the bus.)
    
*   Der Film _basiert_ _auf meinem_ Leben. (The film is based on my life.)

#### Contractions

Some prepositions and articles can be contracted.


|an + das    |ans    |
|------------|-------|
|an + dem    |am     |
|auf + das   |aufs   |
|bei + dem   |beim   |
|in + das    |ins    |
|in + dem    |im     |
|hinter + das|hinters|
|über + das  |übers  |
|um + das    |ums    |
|unter + das |unters |
|von + dem   |vom    |
|vor + das   |vors   |
|zu + dem    |zum    |
|zu + der    |zur    |


*   Wir gehen _ins_ Kino (We go to the cinema.)

If you would use "that" in English, you would not use a contraction:

*   In _das_ Kino gehe ich nicht! (I won't go into _that_ cinema!)

#### Preposition at the end of a sentence??

An important part of German grammar is that some verbs can split off their prefix. This often ends up at the end of a sentence. Some of these prefixes look exactly like a preposition.

So when you see a "preposition" at the end of a sentence, try to combine it with the verb. You might just have learned a new word :)

*   Sie _macht_ die Lampe _an_. (_anmachen_ means "turn on" here)
    
*   Ich _denke nach_. (_nachdenken_ means "to think")
    
*   _Pass_ auf dich _auf_! (_aufpassen_ means "to take care")
    
*   Wann _fährt_ der Zug _ab_? (_abfahren_ means "to depart")
    
*   _Nimm_ deinen Hut _ab_! (_abnehmen_ means "to take off" in this context)
    

Unfortunately, the way Duolingo is built does not allow to selectively teach German sentence structure. We hope this will change soon :)

### _Zu Hause_ vs. _nach Hause_

_Zu Hause_ means _at home_, and _nach Hause_ means _home_ (_homewards_, not _at home_). The _\-e_ at the end of _zu Hause_ and _nach Hause_ is an archaic dative ending, which is no longer used in modern German, but survives in certain fixed expressions.

*   Ich bin _zu Hause_. (I am _at home_.)
    
*   Ich gehe _nach Hause_. (I am walking _home_.)
    

#### Cooking #3 · 2022-03-25[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Cooking/practice) ^

### _Zu Mittag_, _zu Abend_

In some combinations, prepositions are not grammatical. Just learn the whole phrase like a word:


|German    |English     |
|----------|------------|
|zu Fuß    |on foot     |
|zu Mittag |for lunch   |
|zu Abend  |for dinner  |
|zu Hause  |at home     |
|nach Hause|towards home|


Especially _zu Hause_ is often confusing, as in regular use, _zu_ often means _towards_.

### _Geben_

_Geben_ (to give) is one of several verbs that describe a transaction. These generally have two objects:

*   the _direct object_ is what changes hands. This is the object you already know: it is in the accusative case.
*   the _indirect object_ identifies the "other person involved" in a transaction. This object is in the dative case.
    
*   Ich gebe _einem Kind_ _einen Apfel_. (I give a child an apple.)
    

As in English, the dative "indirect" object comes before the accusative "direct" object.

English can also use "to": "I gave an apple to a child." — this is not possible in German.

_Geben_ is a strong (slightly irregular) verb, here are its forms:


|Person     |geben  |
|-----------|-------|
|ich        |gebe   |
|du         |gibst  |
|er/sie/es  |gibt   |
|wir        |geben  |
|ihr        |gebt   |
|sie/Sie    |geben  |
|perf. part.|gegeben|


#### Verbs: Conditional 2 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Verbs:-Conditional-2/practice) ^

#### Conditional mood

Please refer to lesson "Verbs: Conditional 1" to review to German's "Konjunktiv II" mood. This is normally formed by a form of _würden_ + infinitive:

*   Wenn ich reich wäre, _würde_ ich den ganzen Tag Deutsch _lernen_. (If I were rich, I _would learn_ German all day.)

#### Konjunktiv I

German has another, lesser used form, the "Konjunktiv I". It is mostly used for marking indirect speech in newspapers:

*   Sänger: "Der Song ist gut!" (direct speech)
*   Der Sänger sagte, _der Song **sei** gut_. (indirect speech)

Therefore, only the third person (singular and plural) is commonly used.

Here are the forms of _present tense_ and _past tense_ (Präteritum), together with the two forms of Konjunktiv, to demonstrate the pattern. Forms in brackets are rarely used:


|person   |present|Konj I  |
|---------|-------|--------|
|ich      |habe   |(habe)  |
|du       |hast   |(habest)|
|er/sie/es|hat    |habe    |
|wir      |haben  |(haben) |
|ihr      |habt   |(habet) |
|sie/Sie  |haben  |(haben) |



|person   |Präteritum|Konj II|
|---------|----------|-------|
|ich      |hatte     |hätte  |
|du       |hattest   |hättest|
|er/sie/es|hatte     |hätte  |
|wir      |hatten    |hätten |
|ihr      |hattet    |hättet |
|sie/Sie  |hatten    |hätten |


As you can see, _Konjunktiv I_ is sometimes the same as the present tense form. In these cases, German uses the Konjunktiv II form:

*   Männer: "Wir haben Hunde!" (direct speech)
*   Die Männer sagten, **sie _hätten_ Hunde**. (indirect speech; uses _hätten_ instead of _haben_)

Here are some commonly used forms:

*   _sein_ (to be) — er _sei_
*   _haben_ (have) — er _habe_
*   _müssen_ (must) — er _müsse_
*   _können_ (can) — er _könne_
*   _wollen_ (want) — er _wolle_

### _Der/Die Außerirdische_: adjectival nouns

Some **adjectives can turn into nouns** in German. If they do so, **they still change endings** like any normal adjective:

*   _deutsch_ (German) — der _Deutsche_
*   _gefangen_ (captive) — der _Gefangene_
*   _alt_ (old) — der _Alte_
*   _außerirdisch_ (extraterrestrial) — der _Außerirdische_
*   _verwandt_ (related) — der _Verwandte_
    
*   der deutsch**e** Mann — der Deutsch**e**
    
*   ein deutsch**er** Mann — ein Deutsch**er**
*   Ich kenne einen deutsch**en** Mann — Ich kenne einen Deutsch**en**.
*   eine deutsch**e** Frau — eine Deutsch**e**
*   der Hund der deutsch**en** Frau — der Hund der Deutsch**en**

… and so on.

Google "german adjectival nouns" for more information.

If you want, now would be a good time to review the adjective endings in earlier lessons :)

### N-declension

Don't confuse adjectival nouns with nouns that follow the "n-declension". (See lesson "Dat. Case" for details)

For example, all other nouns for nationalities that end in _\-e_ follow the n-declension:

*   der Brite, der Chinese, der Ire, …

#### Relative Pronouns #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Relative-Pronouns/practice) ^

### Relative clauses

In English, relative clauses look like this:

*   The girl _who came to visit him_ was his aunt.
*   The man, _whose daughter worked as a manager_, came home.

In German, relative clauses are subordinate clauses. The verb moves from position 2 to the end.

*   Der Mann kauft Hundefutter. Ihm gehört der Hund. (The man buys dog food. The dog belongs to him.)
*   Der Mann, _dem der Hund gehört_, kauft Hundefutter. (The man _to whom the dog belongs_ buys dog food.)

Relative clauses are _always_ set off by commas from the rest of the sentence.

(There's no distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive clauses.)

#### Relative pronouns

The **relative pronouns look like the definite articles**, with the **exception of the dative plural and the genitive** forms.

The relative pronouns closely correspond to the personal pronouns they replace:

*   Das ist der Mann. _Er_ hat einen Hund.
*   Das ist der Mann, _der_ einen Hund hat.
    
*   Das sind die Bälle. Mit _ihnen_ spielt er. (These are the balls. He plays with them.)
    
*   Das sind die Bälle, mit _denen_ er spielt.


|pers. pronoun|rel. pronoun|grammar             |
|-------------|------------|--------------------|
|er           |der         |masc. (nom.)        |
|es           |das         |neut. (nom.+acc.)   |
|sie          |die         |fem./pl. (nom.+acc.)|
|ihn          |den         |masc. (acc.)        |
|ihm          |dem         |masc.+neut. (dat.)  |
|ihr          |der         |fem. (dat.)         |
|ihnen        |denen       |pl. (dat.)          |


Relative pronouns can never be dropped.

#### Genitive relative clauses

The **genitive version derives from the possessive pronoun**:

*   Die Frau ist krank. **Ihr** Sohn hat einen Hund.
*   Die Frau, **deren Sohn** einen Hund hat, ist krank.
    
*   Der Mann mag Pizza. **Sein**e Tochter kann singen. (The man likes pizza. His daughter can sing.)
    
*   Der Mann, **dessen** Tochter singen kann, mag Pizza.

Here, too, the possessive pronouns correspond somewhat to the relative pronouns:


|poss. pronoun|rel. pronoun|grammar    |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
|sein(*)      |dessen      |masc./neut.|
|ihr(*)       |deren       |fem./pl.   |


#### The relative clause determines which pronoun to use

Be aware that the **relevant case is in the relative clause**, not the main clause:

*   _Der Hund_ schläft. (Hund = nominative)
*   Ich mag _den Hund_. (Hund = accusative)
*   Der Hund, **den** ich mag, schläft. (use accusative relative pronoun)

The form you need to use is governed by the grammatical gender and number of the word that is being referred to (outside the relative clause), and the case is governed by the context of the relative clause.

Keep in mind that certain prepositions and verbs always trigger a certain case, e.g. the preposition _mit_ always takes the dative case and so does the verb _helfen_.

*   Das Kind schläft. Die Frau hat _ihm_ geholfen. (The kid sleeps. The woman helped him.)
*   Das Kind, _dem_ die Frau geholfen hat, schläft.

### What is a _Wurst?_

A _Wurst_ is a sausage. It does not specifically refer to any kind of sausage. It could be a salami, chorizo, mortadella, frankfurter, etc.

_Bratwurst_ specifically refers to a fried or grilled sausage.

#### Frequency #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Frequency/practice) ^

### _Ob_

Indirect questions are subordinate clauses in German:

*   Was _machst_ du? (direct question, verb in position 2)
*   Ich weiß, was du _machst_! ("I know what you do!", verb at the end)

For questions with a question word, the question word starts the sentece, and the verb ends it.

For yes/no-questions, German uses _ob_ as a placeholder (just like "whether" is used in English):

*   Gehst du ins Kino?
*   Er fragt, _ob_ du ins Kino _gehst_.

### _Je … desto …_

_Je … desto …_ works roughly like "the … the …" in English:

*   _The longer_ I learn German, _the happier_ I become.
*   _Je länger_ ich Deutsch lerne, _desto glücklicher_ werde ich.

However, the sentence structure is unusual, when compared to English. For the above sentence, it is:

*   je + (comparison) (subject) (rest) (verb), desto (comparison) (verb) (subject) (rest)

The _je_ part is a subordinate clause, so the verb will be at the end. Because the _je_+comparison is in the first position, the subject has to come immediately after, followed by the rest of the sentence.

The _desto_ part is a main clause. The verb is in position 2, and _desto_+comparison are in the first position. This is not unusual in German, as you can put all kinds of elements in the first position:


|Position 1      |2   |3     |4               |5                |
|----------------|----|------|----------------|-----------------|
|Ich             |esse|morgen|mit einem Freund|zu Mittag.       |
|Morgen          |esse|ich   |mit einem Freund|zu Mittag.       |
|Mit einem Freund|esse|ich   |morgen          |zu Mittag.       |
|Zu Mittag       |esse|ich   |morgen          |mit einem Freund.|


Notice how the verb is always in the second position. The subject is either at the beginning (the default), or directly behind the verb.

#### _Mal_

_(-)mal_ can often be translated with "time(s)" in English:


|German       |English       |
|-------------|--------------|
|zehn mal     |ten times     |
|manchmal     |sometimes     |
|das erste Mal|the first time|


In addition, it has a function as a "modal particle". These are words that give a sentence an additional flavor, and can't be easily translated. Modal particles are almost never emphasized.

*   Komm _mal_ nach Hause! (_I'm impatient_, come home!)
*   Kann ich _mal_ vorbei? (Can I get through? _I won't bother you for long._)

We don't teach modal particles in this course (because you can't translate them). But you will encounter _mal schauen_ in this lesson, which roughly means "let's see".

#### Body 1 #5 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Body-and-parts-of-the-body-1/practice) ^

#### _Hals_

_Der Hals_ refers to the whole connection between head and shoulders. German does have more specialized words for "neck" and "throat", but we normally use _Hals_ for both.

#### _Haare_

_Das Haar_ normally refers to a single hair. It _can_ be used to refer to all the hair on someone's head, but is considered slightly outdated or poetic.

*   Seine Haare sind lang. (ok)
*   Sein Haar ist lang. (sounds a bit old)

#### _Bein_

_Das Bein_ refers to the leg. It used to mean "bone" a long time ago. This meaning survives in some word combinations:

*   Elfenbein (ivory, literally "elephant bone")
*   Eisbein (pork knuckle, literally "ischias bone", because it referred to hip meat before)
*   Beinhaus (bone house)
*   Gebein(e) (a collection of bones)

#### _Magen_

_Der Magen_ is the stomach, the part of your body that starts digestion. It is not commonly used to refer to the belly (_der Bauch_).

#### _Brust_

_Die Brust_ can have several meanings, depending on context.

*   Komm an meine Brust! - This means the chest area. It will always be used in the singular.
*   Vögel haben keine Brüste. (Birds don't have breasts) - This refers to female breasts. It can be used in the singular.

#### Adverbs #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adverbs-1/practice) ^

### How do you like things in German?

Use the verb _mögen_ to express that you like something or someone, and use the adverb _gern(e)_ to express that you like doing something.

#### _Mögen_ is used for things, animals, and people:

*   Ich mag Bier. (I like beer.)
    
*   Sie mag Katzen. (She likes cats.)
    
*   Wir mögen dich. (We like you.)
    
*   Ihr mögt Bücher. (You like books.)
    

Please refer to lesson "Present 1" for more details on _mögen_.

#### _Gern(e)_ is used for verbs/activities:

*   Ich trinke gern(e) Bier. (I like to drink beer/I like drinking beer.)
    
*   Er spielt gern(e) Fußball. (He likes to play soccer/He likes playing soccer.)
    
*   Wir lesen gern(e) Bücher. (We like to read books/We like reading books.)
    
*   Sie schreibt gern(e) Briefe. (She likes to write letters/She likes writing letters.)
    

#### Position of _gerne_

If you're not sure **where to put _gern(e)_**: It goes to the same position as _oft_ (often).

*   Ich trinke **oft** Bier. (I drink beer often.)
*   Ich trinke **gern** Bier. (I like to drink beer.)

### _Gern/gerne_, _allein/alleine_

What's the difference between **_gern _and_ gerne_**? They're just variations of the same word. There's no difference in terms of meaning or style. You can use whichever you like best.

The same goes for _allein(e)_.

### Position of _auch_

_Auch_ corresponds to English "also, too".

The positioning follows different rules in both languages. Soon you will learn more about the peculiarities of German sentence structure. For now, remember that _auch_ takes roughly the same position as _nicht_. When both occur together, _auch_ will come before _nicht_.

Consider these two examples to get a first idea about this:

*   Ich laufe. Du läufst **auch**. Er läuft **nicht**. Sie läuft **auch nicht**.
    
*   Ich komme aus China. Du kommst **auch** aus China. Er kommt **nicht** aus China. Sie kommt **auch nicht** aus China.
    

Here's one more adverb, to see how they work together:

*   Ich trinke **oft** Bier. Du trinkst **auch oft** Bier. Er trinkt **nicht oft** Bier. Sie trinkt **auch nicht oft** Bier.

For reasons that will become clearer soon, _Sie kommt aus China **auch**._ is **not a valid sentence** in German.

#### Numbers 2 #2 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Numbers-2/practice) ^

#### German numbers

You learned earlier that the numbers from 1-19 are very similar to those in English.

This mostly continues in German, with one important quirk. Did you ever notice that the digits in numbers 13-19 are kind of "switched" in English? German continues that through to 99.

So **84 would be _vier|und|acht|zig_** (literally, four and eighty).

This might take some getting used to, but at least it's consistent ;)

#### Hundert

For "100", people would usually just say _hundert_, not _einhundert_ (as in English).

#### Huge numbers

There used to be two different systems for huge numbers, called "short scale" and "long scale". Unfortunately, German and American English ended up with different ones. British English used to use the long scale, but switched to short scale.


|Number|US English  (short scale)|German (long scale)|
|------|-------------------------|-------------------|
|10^6  |million                  |Million            |
|10^9  |billion                  |Milliarde          |
|10^12 |trillion                 |Billion            |
|10^15 |quadrillion              |Billiarde          |
|10^18 |quintillion              |Trillion           |


_(10^6 means a one with six zeros)_

#### Location #2 · 2022-01-20[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Location/practice) ^

### Location

#### _Hier, da, dort_

When talking about locations in English, you can use _here_, _there_, _this_, and _that_ to express that something is close or far away. In German the word _da_ is commonly used when talking about locations. The good thing about _da_ is, you don't have to worry about the distance! It can mean anything close or far away.

Let's look at a few examples:

*   Wir sind _da_. (We are here/there.)
*   _Da_ ist ein Apfel. (Here/There is an apple.)

With _hier_ (here) and _dort_ (there) you can be more specific about the distance.

*   hier (here)
*   da (here/there)
*   dort (there)

You can also say _da oben_ for "up there" and so on:

*   Die Katze ist _da oben_. (The cat is up there.)
*   _Da hinten_ wohnt er. (He lives there in the back.)

#### _Das hier_

You can combine all of them with articles, and use them similar to _this_ and _that_ !

*   das hier (this)
*   das da (this/that)
*   das dort (that)

Many people use this with the other articles as well. Note that while all of the following constructs are commonly used in spoken language, they are not appropriate for written, formal language.

*   der/die/das hier (this)
*   der/die/das da (this/that)
*   der/die/das dort (that)

To refer to one specific thing, you can put a noun between the article and _hier/da/dort_.

For example:

*   Der Apfel _da_ ist groß. (That apple is big.)
*   Die Katzen _da_ sind süß. (Those cats are cute.)

Some people might add _drüben_. This translates to _over there_.

*   Der Apfel _da drüben_ ist groß. (That apple _over there_ is big.)
*   Die Katzen _dort drüben_ sind süß. (Those cats _over there_ are cute.)

#### _Innen, drinnen_

_Innen_ and _außen_ mostly refer to the inside and outside of objects.

_Drinnen_ and _draußen_ are normally only used for rooms (more generally, enclosed spaces that people can be in).

*   Die Wassermelone ist _innen_ rot und _außen_ grün. (The watermelon is red on the inside, and green on the outside.)
*   _Drinnen_ ist es trocken, aber _draußen_ regnet es. (Inside, it is dry, but outside it is raining.)

### _Eineinhalb_

Here is an overview of time spans:


|Minuten|                      |
|-------|----------------------|
|10     |zehn Minuten          |
|15     |eine Viertelstunde    |
|30     |eine halbe Stunde     |
|45     |eine Dreiviertelstunde|
|60     |eine Stunde           |
|90     |eineinhalb Stunden    |
|120    |zwei Stunden          |
|150    |zweieinhalb Stunden   |


When speaking, pay attention to the endings (marked in bold) of _eine halbe Stunde_ and _eineinhalb Stunden_. If you mix these up, people will think you mean the other one.

_Eineinhalb_ literally means "one, one half" (60+30). Some people use _anderthalb_ instead.

### _Alleine_

Just as with _gern(e)_, _alleine_ can omit the _\-e_, without a change in meaning.

#### Numbers 3 #4 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Numbers-3/practice) ^

### Ordinal numbers

German ordinal numbers are pretty regular. The general rule is:


|number range|ending|
|------------|------|
|1-19        |-te   |
|> 19        |-ste  |



|   |Irregular forms|
|---|---------------|
|1. |erste          |
|3. |dritte         |
|7. |siebte         |


Ordinal numbers behave like adjectives, so their endings will change accordingly:

Er kennt de**n** erste**n** Sänger.

Er ist a**m** sechste**n** August geboren.

Ich bin sein**e** tausendst**e** Lehrerin.

#### Medical #2 · 2022-01-20[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Medical/practice) ^

### What is a _Pflaster?_

_Das Pflaster_ is a small adhesive bandage.

Depending on where you live, you may call it "Band-Aid", "plaster" or "Elastoplast" in English.

The German word _Pflaster_ does **not** refer to a plaster cast. The German for plaster cast is _der Gips(verband)_.

#### Feelings 2 #8 · 2022-01-20[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Feelings-2/practice) ^

### Long and short vowels

#### Which sounds are there?

In German, every vowel can be long or short. The short one often sounds more open than the long one.

The IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is given for the geeks among you :) But you can also copy/paste one of these symbols into Wikipedia to get an in-depth explanation of it (with sound!).


|vowel|short |IPA|long  |IPA |
|-----|------|---|------|----|
|a    |Mann  |/a/|Bahn  |/aː/|
|ä    |Bälle |/ɛ/|Käse  |/ɛː/|
|e    |rennen|/ɛ/|Beere |/eː/|
|i    |Mitte |/ɪ/|ziehen|/iː/|
|o    |oft   |/ɔ/|ohne  |/oː/|
|ö    |Hölle |/œ/|schön |/øː/|
|u    |Mutter|/ʊ/|Buch  |/uː/|
|ü    |Müll  |/ʏ/|Bücher|/yː/|


You can also google "german sounds" for a longer introduction to German sounds.

#### When is a vowel short or long?

German has a range of spelling convention which will clearly show whether a vowel is short or long:

A vowel before a double consonant will be short:

*   Mann, denn, Mutter, Bälle, backen, Pizza, Katze

Note that instead of "zz" (which only occurs in the Italian "Pizza"), German uses _tz_. Instead of "kk", we use _ck_.

There are also some signals that clearly show the vowel is long.

Sometimes, the vowel will be doubled:

*   p_aa_r, B_ee_re, B_oo_t, … (this only happens with _a/e/o_)

There might be a silent _h_ behind the vowel:

*   f_ah_ren, z_äh_len, s_eh_en, _ih_r, _oh_ne, h_öh_er, _Uh_r, St_üh_le, …

Note that if you read the list above, you should not hear a single _h_ sound. It is _geh|en_, not _ge|hen_.

For _i_, it is more common to have an _\-e_ after it (sometimes even _\-eh_):

*   d_ie_, B_ie_ne, sp_ie_len, s_ie_ben, Bez_ieh_ung, …

Again, the _h_ will be silent: _Be|zieh|ung_, not _Be|zie|hung_.

But sometimes, there will not be a signal.

The following examples have an unmarked long vowel:

*   B_u_ch, d_a_, _A_bend, w_o_, Not, Zitr_o_ne, …

And here are some short ones:

*   _a_n, _O_nkel, _u_n-, M_a_m_a_, H_ä_lfte, Z_i_trone, …

For these, you just have to trust your language feeling, it will normally not be a big problem :)

#### Education #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Education/practice) ^

### _Student_ or _Schüler?_

A _Student_ is a university student and a _Schüler_ is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called _Schüler_.

### A _Hochschule_ is not a _high school_

Careful: a _Hochschule_ is not a high school. Depending on the context, _Hochschule_ is either an umbrella term that comprises _Universitäten_ and _Fachhochschulen_, or it's a synonym for _Fachhochschule_.

A _Universität_ is a full research university and a _Fachhochschule_ (often just called _Hochschule_) is a university with a practical focus that offers Bachelor and Master degrees. PhD programmes may be offered in cooperation with other universities.

### A _Gymnasium_ is not a _gym_

In German, the word _das Gymnasium_ refers to a university prep-school.

The German for a sports gym is _die Turnhalle_ (used by schools and sports clubs) or _das Fitnessstudio_ (commercial).

#### Science #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Science/practice) ^

### _Motor, Motoren_

Normally, nouns don't change the stress pattern when they change into the plural:

*   Ele_fan_t, Ele_fan_ten
*   Ge_le_genheit, Ge_le_genheiten

Nouns ending in _\-or_ are an exception. In the plural, the emphasis lands on the _\-or-_ syllable.

*   D_ok_tor, Dok_to_ren
*   _Mo_tor, Mo_to_ren

#### Dates 2 #4 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Dates-2/practice) ^

### _Monatlich_

Just as in English you have "year/yearly", German has the same word pairs. In German, some of these have an umlaut change:


|noun       |adjective |
|-----------|----------|
|das Jahr   |jährlich  |
|der Monat  |monatlich |
|der Tag    |täglich   |
|die Stunde |stündlich |
|die Minute |minütlich |
|die Sekunde|sekündlich|


Why does _monatlich_ not change? All others are emphasized on the syllable that changes. _Monatlich_ is emphasized on the first syllable.

### Seasons

The seasons in German are as follows:


|English|German      |
|-------|------------|
|spring |der Frühling|
|summer |der Sommer  |
|autumn |der Herbst  |
|winter |der Winter  |


_Herbst_ sounds similar to "harvest", and _Frühling_ has _früh_ (early) in it.

When you refer to seasons or months, you use _im_. Here's the mnemonic again that helps you remind which is which:

*   **a**m Mont**a**g
*   **u**m drei **U**hr
*   **i**m Jun**i**

#### Time #5 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Time/practice) ^

### Times of day

German uses a system similar to English:


|English  |German         |              |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
|morning  |der Morgen     |am Morgen     |
|-        |der Vormittag  |am Vormittag  |
|noon     |der Mittag     |am Mittag     |
|afternoon|der Nachmittag |am Nachmittag |
|evening  |der Abend      |am Abend      |
|night    |die Nacht      |in der Nacht  |
|midnight |die Mitternacht|um Mitternacht|


It's generally pretty straightforward. Remember this mnemonic:

*   **a**m Mont**a**g
*   **u**m drei **U**hr
*   **i**m Jun**i**

_Am Montag_, _am Mittag_. Just "at night there are different rules": _in der Nacht_ and _um Mitternacht_ are irregular.

All of these have an adverbial form:

*   morgen_s_, vormittag_s_, abend_s_, nacht_s_, …

#### _Morgen am Morgen_?

Similar to Spanish, the **words for "tomorrow" and "morning" are the same** in German. Unlike Spanish, German escapes this problem by choosing a different word when they clash.

Instead of _morgen am Morgen_ or _morgen morgens_ we say **morgen früh**.

### Telling the time

#### Official time

In German, there are "official" and informal ways to say the time. Here's the official one (often used on radio and television):

*   dreizehn Uhr neun (literally, "thirteen o'clock nine")

Official time uses a 24 hour system, from zero to 24.

Don't confuse "hour" and _Uhr_ (they are false friends):


|English |German    |
|--------|----------|
|the hour|die Stunde|
|o'clock |Uhr       |


_Die Uhr_ can also mean "clock" or "watch". _Die Stunde_ can also mean "lesson" (which confusingly might not last one hour).

#### Informal time

In everyday life, people will often use informal time.

There are several systems, with two forms dominant. In many parts of Germany, this system is used:


|Time |English             |German             |
|-----|--------------------|-------------------|
|14:05|five past two       |fünf nach zwei     |
|14:10|ten past two        |zehn nach zwei     |
|14:15|a quarter past two  |Viertel nach zwei  |
|14:20|twenty past two     |zwanzig nach zwei  |
|14:25|twenty-five past two|fünf vor halb drei |
|14:30|half past two       |halb drei          |
|14:35|thirty-five past two|fünf nach halb drei|
|14:40|twenty to three     |zwanzig vor drei   |
|14:45|a quarter to three  |Viertel vor drei   |
|14:50|ten to three        |zehn vor drei      |
|14:55|five to three       |fünf vor drei      |


Yes, the part in the middle is very confusing :) German considers the next hour to be half full. In addition, German relates "X:25" and "X:35" to the half hour.

#### Body 2 #7 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Body-2/practice) ^

### _Hirn, Gehirn_

The words _das Gehirn_ und _das Hirn_ are used more or less interchangeably in German.

#### Nature 2 #2 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Nature-2/practice) ^

### _Der See_ vs. _die See_

_Der See_ means "the lake". _**Die** See_ means "the sea, the ocean". It is less commonly used. German uses more often _das Meer_ or _der Ozean_ for the latter.

Check out _Bodensee_ and _Nordsee_ on Google Maps and see if you can figure out which one is feminine and which one is masculine :)

### _Der Strand_

_Der Strand_ means "the beach". This meaning still survives in the English adjective "stranded" (literally, ended up on a lonely beach).

### _Holz, Wald, Forst_

In English, "wood" can refer to a material, and to a forest.

In German, _Holz_ only refers to the material. _Der Wald_ is "the forest". We also have a word _Der Forst_, but it only refers to a maintained forest (something like a garden for trees), where the trees are grown for commercial purposes.

#### Spiritual #2 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Spiritual/practice) ^

### _Wunderbar_

Due to its use as a loanword in English, _wunderbar_ is often overused by English-speaking learners of German. Contrary to popular opinion, most Germans don't run around in leather trousers, smiling broadly and shouting _Wunderbar!_ at each other :)

Think of it as the equivalent to "splendid!". If you want to sound less antiquated, better use _Super!_ or _Toll!_ or something like that.

#### Banking #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Banking/practice) ^

### _Das Konto, die Konten_

Most nouns in German for the plural by appending an ending. There might be an umlaut change.

*   der Hund, die Hund_e_
*   das H_au_s, die H_äu_s_er_

A few loanwords will instead replace the singular ending with a different one:

*   das Kont_o_, die Kont_en_

You will learn more of these in the skill "Business 2".

#### Business 2 #3 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Business-2/practice) ^

#### _Firma_

Most nouns in German get their plural by attaching an ending. There might be an umlaut change:

*   der Hund, die Hund_e_
*   das Haus, die H_äu_s_er_

A few nouns (from Ancient Greek and Latin) will instead replace a singular ending with a different plural ending:

*   das Muse_um_, die Muse_en_ (same for _Zentrum_, etc.)
*   die Firm_a_, die Firm_en_
*   das Kont_o_, die Kont_en_
*   das Vir_us_, die Vir_en_
*   das Vis_um_, die Vis_a_

#### Objects #4 · 2021-10-07[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Objects/practice) ^

### _Hose, Schere, Brille_

Pants used to be two hoses, until somebody had the idea of stitching them together. Glasses are now joined into one object. If you deconstruct scissors into multiple objects, you have two awkward knives and a screw.

**German uses the singular for all of these**. _Die Hose_ is "a pair of pants". _Die Hosen_ (plural) is at least two pairs of pants.

### _Stelle_

_Die Stelle_ has the meaning of "position" in at least two ways. It can be a location, or it can be a job position.

### _Geschenk, Gift_

The common German word German for "gift" is _das Geschenk_. **_Das Gift_ means "poison"**. The reason is that a long time ago, "gift" in the meaning of "something that is given" was used as an euphemism for poison.

*   "Why did he die?"
*   "Kunigunde gave him something."

The original meaning survives in the word _die Mitgift_ (dowry).

#### Adverbs 2 #4 · 2021-02-15[](https://www.duolingo.com/skill/de/Adverbs-2/practice) ^

### _Damit_ vs. _damit_

There are two words spelled _damit_ in German.

One is a **combination of a pronoun and a preposition** (_da+mit_). It means **"with that"**.

*   Das ist ein Stift. _Damit_ schreibe ich. (That's a pen. _With that_, I write.)
*   Ich habe ein Deutschzertifikat. _Damit_ kann ich in Deutschland studieren. (I have a German certificate. _With that_, I can study in Germany.)

This word is generally emphasized on the first syllable. As any standard sentence element, if it is used in the first position, the subject will have to go after the verb (which has to be in position 2).

The other is a **subordinating conjunction**. It translates to **"so that"**:

*   Ich kaufe einen Stift, _damit_ ich schreiben **kann**. (I buy a pen _so that_ I can write.)
*   Ich lerne Deutsch, _damit_ ich in Deutschland studieren **kann**. (I learn German _so that_ I can study in Germany.)

Because it creates a subordinate clause, **the verb of that clause has to go to the end**. This version of _damit_ is pronounced at the second syllable.

To remember which is which, remember that the one that's emphasized at the end also sends the verb to the end.

### _Damit, um … zu …, zum …_

There are at least three ways to express a goal.

#### _Zum_

The easiest just takes a simple verb:

*   Ich fahre _zum Skifahren_ nach Japan. (I go to Japan _for_ skiing.)
*   _Zum Lachen_ geht er in den Keller. (He goes to the basement _to_ laugh.)

The verb becomes a noun here, hence the upper-case initial, and the _zum_ (zu+dem) preposition. If a verb turns into a noun, it always gets neuter gender (das Essen, das Lachen).

#### _Um … zu …_

If you have a more complicated verb complex (for example, with adverbs or objects), you cannot use _zum_. Use _um … zu …_ instead:

*   Ich gehe ins Restaurant, _um_ mit Freunden Pizza _zu_ essen. (I go to the restaurant _in order to_ eat pizza with friends.)

To do this, you start with an infinitive construction:

*   _mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein**kaufen**_ (to go shopping in the supermarket with friends)

If you were to use this in a sentence, it would look like this:

*   Ich **kaufe** _mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein_.

The _um_ goes to the beginning of the infinitive construction. The _zu_ goes where the verb part (in the above example, _kaufen_) splits off.

*   Ich fahre in die Stadt, _um_ mit Freunden im Supermarkt ein_zu_kaufen.

#### _Damit_

If your main sentence has a different subject than your goal, you can't use an infinitive. Use _damit_, which comes with a subordinate clause.

*   _Ich_ gebe ihm mein Handy, _damit_ _er_ seine Mutter anrufen kann. (I give him my phone _so that_ he can call his mom)

Read the section "_damit_ vs. _damit_" for more information on how to use it.

### _Womit? Damit!_

Many prepositions can be combined with _wo-_ and _da-_. _Da_ roughly translates to "that" here, _wo_ normally to "what" (not "where" which is its normal meaning).


|wo-       |da-       |
|----------|----------|
|woran     |daran     |
|worauf    |darauf    |
|woraus    |daraus    |
|wobei     |dabei     |
|wodurch   |dadurch   |
|wofür     |dafür     |
|wogegen   |dagegen   |
|wohinter  |dahinter  |
|worin     |darin     |
|womit     |damit     |
|wonach    |danach    |
|worum     |darum     |
|worüber   |darüber   |
|worunter  |darunter  |
|wovon     |davon     |
|wovor     |davor     |
|wozu      |dazu      |
|wozwischen|dazwischen|


If the **preposition starts with a vowel**, there will be a **binding _r_**. So _worum_ is pronounced _wo-rum_ (not _wor-um_).
